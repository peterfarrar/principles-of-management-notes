# Managerial Decision-making
## Introduction
### Stephanie Korey and Jen Rubio founded a luggage company
They both had a background in e-commerce/direct to consumer.  
One had a background in branding and marketing, the other in supply chain management.  
They did extensive research in to the luggage industry to understand why quality and pricing were the way they were.  
They interviewed hundreds of users to learn their likes and dislikes around luggage.  

## 2.1 Overview of Managerial Decision-Making
"**Decision-making** is the action or process of thinking through possible options and selecting one."  
**stakeholders** are anyone impacted by organizational decisions.  
Decisions can impact productivity, expenses, morale, turnover, etc.  

Managers need to gather information before making a decision. Often managers have incomplete information.  
If a manager waits too long to gather information they can miss opportunities, while if they make decisions too quickly they can have negative impact on the organization.  
It is important to recognize a poor decision and correct it quickly to reduce impact on the organization and its shareholders.  
There is rarely a 'right' option, merely better and worse options. Sometimes there are only bad options and a decision must be made to select the least negative one.  

Some decisions have **Ethical** implications. Short term gain may result in long term impacts that cost stakeholders in the future. Especially when that decision causes harm to others.  

1. What are some positive outcomes of decision-making for an organization? What are some possible negative outcomes?  
Positive outcomes include improving efficiency, preparing the organization for further success, increased profitability.  
Negative outcomes include degrading morale, increased turnover, loss of revenue, missed opportunities.  
2. How is managerial decision-making different from a multiple-choice test?  
Unlike multiple choice, a managerial decision may not have a right or wrong option. Often options are simply different, some better, some worse.  
1. In addition to the owners of a business, who are some of the other stakeholders that managers should consider when making decisions?  
Shareholders, trading partners, customers, the local community are all stakeholders that may be impacted by managerial decision-making.  

## 2.2 How the Brain Processes Information to Make Decisions: Reflective and Reactive Systems
Two types of decision making are Reactive and Reflective. They take place in different regions of the brain, with the prefrontal cortex hosting Reflective decision-making and the basal ganglia and amygdala hosting the Reactive.  

Reactive decision-making is faster. Experience can lead to decent reactive decision making. But reactive decision-making is not well thought out.  
Reflective decision-making takes longer. It is used for complex situations. It processes information logically, analytically, and methodically.  
Although emotions can have a negative impact on decision making, they shouldn't be ignored. Managers must observe and understand their emotional responses when making decisions. **Emotional Intelligence** is that ability to recognize, understand, and pay attention to both one's own emotions (self-awareness) and the emotions of others(empathy), to self-regulate one's emotions, and to have the social skills to manage the emotioal part of relationships.

1. Explain the two systems used by the brain in decision-making.  
The brain has two systems of decision-making, reactive and reflexive.  
Reactive decisions are fast, impulsive, often based on gut feelings, or experience with similar circumstances.  
Reflexive decsions take time and involve logical, methodical, and analytical consideration.  
1. What is emotional intelligence, and why is it important for decision-making?  
Emotional intelligence is a combination of self-awareness, empathy, self-regulation, and the social skills to manage emotions within relationships.  

## 2.3 Programmed and Nonprogrammed Decisions
Because of the limited time available to a manager, they must be able to distinguish between decisions that are routine(programmed) and those that are novel(non-programmed).  

**Programmed decisions** are decisions where the criteria is well understood. These are also called 'routine' or 'low-involvement' decisions. A process for determining the best decision is already known and must simply be applied. Many purchase and production decisions are based on known criteria. Scheduling is an example of a programmed decision.  **Heuristics** (mental shortcuts) developed over time can provide shortcuts. It may not be the best decision, but it will be close enough.  

**Nonprogrammed decisions** are new. Their criteria is not well defined. These are also known as 'nonroutine' or 'high-involvement' decisions. Information will be incomplete. There will be many unknowns. They take more time and care.  

### The Decision-Making Process
There are six steps in the decision-making process:  
1. Recognize that a decision needs to be made
1. Generate multiple options
1. Analyze the options
1. Select an option
1. Implement the decision
1. Evaluate whether the decision is effective

Managers should not skip any of these steps.  

Programmed decisions, with heuristics, can use the reactive decision-making process.
Nonprogrammed decisions require the reflective decision-making process.  

1. Give an example of a programmed decision that a manager might face.  
An employee has called in sick. Manager knows to call other employees to cover, or cover themselves. This is not a new situation.  
2. Give an example of a nonprogrammed decision.  
A manager believes Generative AI needs to be incorporated into their product if they are to remain competative. There are many unknowns to be considered. Which GenAI brand is most effective and will it be the one that survives after the initial GenAI craze? How is it best integrated? What will the short and long term costs be to the organization?  
3. What are heuristics, and when are they helpful?  
Heuristics are decision patterns that have been developed over time and are teachable. They offer quick solutions to known situations. Take the answer from question 1. A manager of a retail shop will probably have already developed a strategy for covering for a sick employee as it is a frequent occurence.  
4. How are programmed and nonprogrammed decisions connected to the reflective and reactive systems in the brain?  
Programmed decisions typically use the reactive system, while nonprogrammed decisions require the reflective system.  

## 2.4 Barriers to Effective Decision-Making
### Bounded Rationality
Complex issues can not be completely understood rationaly because there are too many possibilities and too much is unknown.  

### Escalation of Commitment
**Escalation of comitment** is when the manager sticks with a decision even after it's determined it was not a good one. This can lead to negative outcomes. Good managers know to cut their losses and reevaluate the situation.  

### Time Constraints
With out enough time to gather information, it can be difficult to make a good decision.  

### Uncertainty
It can be difficult to know the outcome of different alternatives without actually implementing them. Managers may need to commit to one option without knowing if another would have been better.  

### Personal Bias
People tend to be more comfortable with the familiar. People tend to place more value on information that reinforces their individual beliefs, aka **confirmation bias**. Challenging personal beliefs can trigger the reactive system in the brain and interfere with logical decision making. Effective managers ask others for opinions and evaluate the situation from multiple perspectives.  

### Conflict
Some decisions involve conflict. There are two basic types of conflict, **process conflict** and **relationship conflict**. Process conflict addresses the way something is done. It can lead to improved proceses and performance. Relationship conflict is more about personality. It can be perceived as a personal attack and should be avoided.  

1. Explain the concept of confirmation bias.  
Confirmation Bias refers to a personal bias towards things that are familiar. That might mean towards people who are more similar to ourselves, or towards things or activities that we are already comfortable with, possibly ruling out better alternatives.  
2. List and describe at least three barriers to effective decision-making.  
* Time Constraints
* Conflict
* Uncertainty 
3. When is conflict beneficial, and when is it harmful? Why?  
Conflict is beneficial when it leads to better results. Conflict is harmful when it makes a person feel attacked.  

## 2.5 Improving the Quality of Decision-Making

### The Importance of Experience
More experience generally have more knowledge to draw from. Able to use heuristics and recognize when additional information is needed.  

### Techniques for Making Better Programmed Decisions
**Heuristics** are used for programmed (routine) decisions.  
**satisficing** is going with the first acceptable solution. It looks good enough and it saves time.  

## Techniques for Making Better Nonprogrammed Decisions
Use the six steps of decision making:  
### 1. Recognize that a decision needs to be made
Ignoring a problem generally makes it worse. Don't be affraid to make decisions.  

### 2. Generating Multiple Alternatives
Don't rush. Get a large number of possible options. Talk to other people and think creatively. Find people with more experience or expertise. Combine information in new ways, looking for patterns. Use your imagination.  

### 3. Analyzing Alternatives
**Evidence-based decision-making** means being systematic and collecting the best information to be effective. Include other stakeholders. Rely on data over intuition.  
**Talk to other people** This can help to reduce personal biases.  
**Critical thinking** involves sisiplined evaluation of information and determining what is quality and what can be trusted.  
Avoid **logical fallacies** (any seemingly reasonable argument based on flawed logic).  
Consider long term implications.  
Consider ethical implications.  
1. Moral sensitivity—recognizing that the issue has a moral component;
2. Moral judgment—determining which actions are right vs. wrong;
3. Moral motivation/intention—deciding to do the right thing; and
4. Moral character/action—actually doing what is right.

**Ethical Decision Tree**
```
                                                                        yes -> is it ethical?                       no ->  dont do it
               yes -> consider whether it maximizes shareholder value?                                              
is it legal?                                                            no ->  would not taking action be ethical?  yes -> dont do it
               no -> dont do it                                                                                     no ->  do it, but don't disclose actions to shareholders
```

### 4. Selecting an Alternative
Perfection is unattainable. Choose the best alternative you can, but accept that it may be impossible to know if it's the best. You can adjust later if necessary.  
Include others in the selection process. Just talking about the decision can offer new insights.  

### 5. Impleneting the Selected Alternative
You must implement the selected alternative. This may have ramifications. It could create some conflict. Everyone may not be happy about it. But it must be implemented.  
If it creates conlict, address the conflict in a productive way.  
If you are unable to implement it, reflect on why. Perhaps there is a valid reason. For example, is it an ethical decision?

### 6. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Your Decision
Do not skip this step. This is an experience that can be learned from.

1. Explain what satisficing is and when it may be a good strategy.  
Satisficing is looking through a list of options and choosing the first one that satisfies the decision's requirements. This is for programmed decisions.  
2. What are the six steps in the decision-making process?
* Recognize the need to make a decision
* Generate a set of alternatives.
* Analyze the alternatives
* Select an alternative
* Implement the alternative
* Evaluate the outcome
3. What are the four steps involved in ethical decision-making?
1. Moral sensitivity
1. Moral judgement
1. Moral motivation/intention
1. Moral character/action

## 2.6 Group Decision-Making
Involving more people in the decision making process can improve the outcome.  

### Advantages of group decisions
Incorporate different perspectives.  
Incorporate more and different ideas.  
This is best accomplished with a diverse group.  
This does create more work.  
Reduces biases.  
More people means more sets of knowledge and experiences.  
**Brainstorming** gereates many solutions.  
Allows more people to have a greater understanding of the issue.  

### Disadvantages of group decisions
Opportunity for conflict.  
Need for agreement.  
**Groupthink** is when people stays silent because they want to avoid conflict.  
Person in position of authority may insist on their own ideas over others.  

### How to form a quality group
Diverse members.  
Perhaps a **devil's advocate** to challenge group evaluations.  

1. Explain why group decision-making can be more effective than individual decision-making.  
It can draw on a larger pool of ideas, knowledge, and experiences, and it can reduce personal biases by including a diverse group of perspectives.  
2. What are some things that can prevent groups from making good decisions?  
Groupthink can cause people to hold their voices back to maintain harmony. Someone might assert their authority and prevent ideas from being considered.  
3. As a manager, what can you do to enhance the quality of group decision-making?  
Select a diverse group. Encorage conversation and oppinions. Use a devil's advocate to scrutinize alternatives.
