## Exploring Managerial Careers: Michael E. Porter
Five forces help determine the level of profitability:
* competition in the industry
* potential of new entrants into the industry
* power of suppliers
* power of customers
* threat of substitute products.

Three generic strategies for success in an unatractive industry:
* focus
* differentiation
* cost leadership (lowest prices)

## 3.1 The Early Origins of Management
*Sumerians* used coins for trade. Writing allowed merchants to keep records of their trades.  
King *Hammurabi* of Babylon created written laws and commands. The 'Code of Hammurabi' listed 282 laws regulating many behaviors including busines dealings.  
Hammurabi set wages to a fixed amount. Later Babylonian king *Nebuchadnezzar* introduced incentives, specifically for weavers, paid in food.  
The *Egyptians* believed the correct number of people for one supervisor to oversee was 10.  
IChinese began to develop bureaucracy, becomming fully developed in the *Han dynasty* (206 BC-220 AD). Participation and promotion within the bureaucracy required testing knowledge of Confucian teaching.  
The *Greeks* developed division of labor, based on Plato's ideas of human diversity.  
The *Romans* introduced standardization of measures, weights, coins, and the trading of stocks to the public.  

## 3.2 The Italian Renaissance
Reintroduction of classical knowledge and emergence of new knowledge had economic and business implications. The printing press allowed knowledge to spread. The combination led to new wealt, an emphasis on trade and wealth creation.  
Improving and developing mining, banking, shipping. Advances in bookkeeping and business management/specialized business managers.  
Italy created the first multinational corporations and multinational banks.  
Introduction of:
* Business managers
* Corporations

## 3.3 The Industiral Revolution (1760 to 1900)
The English word 'management' was introduced.  

#### Adam Smith
Specialization and coordination within corporations reduced costs of goods. Reduced need for training (only teach limited set of skills). Required coordination of tasks emphasised need for management.  

#### Steam engine
Improved transportation of goods and materials. Lowered production costs/transportation costs/extended distance of distribution/lowerd product costs.  

The Industrial Revolution shifted production from small "home" production to large, standardized, factory production. Factories employed hundreds of workers and produced goods at lower price than the cost of small producers.  
In the US, railroads, canals and the telegraph impacted the transportation of goods, materials, and information. This all shifted the US economy away from farmers, towards corporations. This required managers to coordinate activities within the company.  
Post Civil War, corporations became larger, factories became larger. Challenges included motivating workers, coordinating workers with tasks, lack of standardized equiptment. Workers were motivated to limit production for job security. Management as a distinct field of study became imortant to solve these challenges.  

## 3.4 Taylor-Made Management

Professional class concerns:  
Permanent underclass of porrly educated workers.  
Workers could be radicalized, disrupt status quo.  
Could lead to strikes/violence.  
Money in big businesses could corrupt politics.  

Working class concerns:  
Fear the work would disappear if they over produced.  
Concerns about wages, job security.  
Workplace Justice.  

Conditions:
Little concern for workers well being.  
No breaks.  
Management v. workforce relationship was contentious.  
Managers would set unreasonable goals.  Workers would band together to under produce.  
Workers that didn't 'solder' with the others would be assulted, or equiptment would be damaged.  
Few incentives.  
Motivation was via punishments.  
No trust.  

There were not enough managers to meet demand.  
Little training was provided.  
First business school wasn't established until 1881 (Wharton).  
Education was anecdotal, not systematic.  

Management as a discipline started in the US.  
Development of the field of management coinsided with sociology and psychology.  
"Drucker stated that the development of management was one of the factors that held off the development of radicalism in the United States because it increased productivity, lowered prices, and increased wages for workers."  
Created middle class.  
Development of management as a systematic/scientific disapline attributed to *Fredric Winslow Taylor* (1856-1915).  

### Frederick Winslow Taylor
The father of scientific management.  
A Quaker from Pennsylvania. Planned to go to Harvard and become a lawyer or executive.  
Suffered eye injury that made reading impossible.  
Went to work at Midvale Steel Company, a family fried's factory.  
Quickly promoted to foeman, then chief engineer.  
Saw actions to reduce production.  
Went to Stevens Institute of Technology to learn engineering.  
Applied engineering knowledge to his work.  

Taylor's ideas were not original, but he combined ideas from different sources into one idea of management.  
* time studies
* division of labor based on function
* cost-control systems
* written instructions for workers
* planning
* standardized equiptment
* incentives (piecework)

Taylor valued knowledge and science over tradition.  
Worked out the most efficient/effective ways to perform a task.  
Worked out quickest execution of daily activities for each worker.  
Trained workers based on results of the afformentioned studies.  
Gave workers rests (breaks), which increased thier productivity.  

"First class work" Is based on determining what a worker could realistically be expected to do.  
Task management system. Allowed supervisors to focus on descrete areas. Allowed supervisors to plan and control workers activities better.  
So, specialization for workers and supervisors.  

Taylorism's four priciples of management:  
1. A manager should develope a rule of science for each job.
1. Scientifically select and train each worker. (Human resource management)
1. Management and the workforce should work together to ensure tht work is performed according to the priciples of management.
1. Work and responsibility should be equally divided between management and workers.

#### Carl G. Barth (1860-1939)
Researched worker fatigue. What made workers tired?  
Sude slide rule to calculate how much steel to cut. This made calculations more rapid.  

#### Henry Gantt (1861-1919)
Developed the Gantt chart.  
Tracked what was supposed to be done vs what was actually done.  
Measure time needed to complete an activity.
Visually represent how much should have been completed.  
Pioneered employee bonus system.  

#### Fran Gilbreth (1868-1924) and Lillian Gilbreth (1878-1972)
Bricklayor found ways to be more efficient and limit his own fatigue.  
Focus was on *motion studies*. Used film to study worker motions. Calculated the most efficient way to perform tasks. Areas included bricklaying, secretarial work, baseball. (can he be credited with introducing studying film in pro sports?)  
Developed a management system for construction sites.  
* no smoking
* $10 for best suggestions on how to improve
* Trained workers in the best way to perform a task
* photograph all accident sites, in case of law suites
* promotion plans, training and development
* performance appraisals
He belived monotony came from workers lack of interest in the job, not the job itself.  
Lillian introduced industrial psychology to the mix.  
Later she focused on domestic efficiency and is credited with designing the modern kitchen.  

#### Taylor's shortcomings
* anti union
* made many enemies
* his ideas were poorly understood
* compared workers to apes, pissing of the workers
* other managers disliked him for putting responsibility for previous failures on them
* angered just about everyone

Talorism was mostly a frontline manager theory, pretending to be an overall theory of management.  
Not great with emotions, personalities, attitudes. Believed money was the primary motivator.  
Taylor leaid a foundation for future researchers to build upon.
