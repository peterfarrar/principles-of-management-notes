# External and Internal Organizational Environments and Corporate Culture
"Evolving business models combine strategic innovation, technological prowess, organizational cultural agility" to meet and shape "external environmental demands."  
Many traditional business models have failed by failing to adapt to technology:  
* DEC
* Poloroid
* Kodak
* Toys R Us
* Blockbuster
* Moterola
* Borders
* Sun Micro

External environmental trends and forces that challenge organizations' survival:
* Digital technologies and AI
* blockchain
* Sharing-economy cultural and economic value-added business models  
   Airbnb and Uber
* Shifts in learning and learning credentials.  
   Khan Academy, Udacity, and Coursera
* Ethics, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability  

## 4.1 The Organization's External Environment
Define the external environment of organizations.  

Organizations adapt, interact, and fit within an external environment.  
Organizations are groups of people working together with a common purpose.  
Types of Organizations:  
* companies
* firms
* corporations
* institutions
* agencies
* associations
* groups
* consortiums
* conglomerates

Takeaways for this chapter:  
1. "Be able to identify elements in any organization’s external—and internal—environment that may interest or affect you as an employee, shareholder, family member, or observer."
1. "Gain insights into how to develop strategies and tactics that would help you (and your organization) navigate ways to cope with or try to dominate or appeal to elements (e.g., market segments, stakeholders, political/social/economic/technological issues) in the environment."

**External Environment** (aka general environment) refers to all outside factors that an organization must respond to:
* sociocultural
* technological
* economic
* government and political
* natural disasters
* human-induced problems that affect industries and organizations


### Economic forces
**Globalization** is a combination of external forces shaping organizations' environments.  
Economic data indicates globalization has had a positive effect on the world economy.  
However 2/3 households in 25 countries with advanced economies havd incomes stagnate or decline between 2005 and 2014.  
Wages fell in the US and the UK.  
Income inequality is rising globally.  

**Technological forces** are a ubiquitous environmental influences on all organizations.  
Some companlies, like shareing-economy companies, use internet technologies to disrupt industries like taxis, short term rentals, hospitality services.  
Companies across all sectors rely on technologies like software, the internet, social media, for their marketing, operations, finances, and sales.  

**Government and political forces** shape the economic environment as well.  
Brexit, Trump's tariffs and policies, wars in the Middle East, health-care reforms, immigration all impact business and can increase uncertainty for businesses. They create opportunities and instabilities.  

### Sociocultural forces
**Sociocultural environmental forces** include values, beliefs, attitudes, customs and traditions, habits, and lifestyles. This includes education, language, religion, law, politics, and social organizations.  
Every generations have differences in these areas from the previous generations.  
Organizations that recognize these differences and adapt to them are better able to attract and retain quality employees.  
Millenials generally attracted to work that intrests and engages them. They are health conscious and eager to learn.  
Gen Z grew up with and are well adapted to technology, and engage regularly with social media.  
Aside from generational differences, there are current sociocultural trends that impact organizations.  
Concerns and awareness with regards to sexual harassment at work require proactive policies in the work place. Relationships between employees, their bosses, and owners require more transparency.  
Young adults live at home longer.  
Diversity in the workplace continues to grow.  
Woman continue to participate in the workplace and have made modest gains into leadership positions.  
A 2018 McKinsey & Company study supports the impact of a diverse workforce (women and minorities) in improving organizations' financial outcomes.  

### Natural disaters and human-related problems
Events like hurricanes, extreme temperatures, and man-made disasters like water and food crises, loss of biodiversity, involuntary migrations, wars, all impact organizations.  
The 2018 Global Risks Report identified environmental risks as higher than average for likelihood and impact over a 10 year horizon.  
Other threats include sea rise, polution, mass-extinction, agricultural systems under strain.  

1. Define the components of the internal and the external business environments.  
Diversity is a sociocultural part of the internal and external business environment. As the workforce becomes more diverse (external) the make up of organizations reflects that (internal).  
Technology is ubiquitous. Externally it is constantly evolving/changing. Internally it is critical for a companies viability.  

2. What factors within the economic environment affect businesses?  
Globalization has shaped wages and opportunities for workers and organizations. It also impacts supply chains, exchange rates, and competition.  

3. Why do demographic shifts and technological developments create both challenges and new opportunities for business?  
These shifts require a business to adapt. Demographic shifts affect the makeup of the workforce and the customer base. It is important to have the internal demographics of an organization reflect the cultural demographics inorder to understand the customer base and find opportunities. Similarly technological developments require businesses to adapt their IT systems in order to stay competetive. They also provide opportunities for new streams of business.  

## 4.2 External Environments and Industries
Identify contemporary external forces pressuring organizations.   

An organizations fit can be evaluated based on the uncertainty of environmental forces. Categorized as Low Uncertainty to High Uncertainty, that rating is based on the number of external elements and how similar they are, and how frequently they change. An organization with few and similar external elements that generally remain the same is said to have Low Uncertainty, one with many dissimilar external elements that change frequently are said to have Hich Uncertainty, and the rest fit in somewhere in between.  

Uncertainty has two measures in this model:  
1. The number of external elements and similarity of them.
1. How stable the elements are.

Uncertainty:  
Simple and Stable = 1  
Complex and Stable = 2  
Simple and Unstable = 3  
Complex and Unstable = 4  

Examples of a Simple Stable environment:
* Soft drink bottlers
* Neer distributors
* Food processors
* Container manufacturers

Examples of a Complex Stable environment:
* Universities
* Appliance Manufactures
* Chemical companies
* Insurance companies

Examples of a Simple Unstable environment:
* E-Commerce
* Music
* Fashion
 
Examples of a Complex Unstable environment:
* Computers
* Aerospace
* Airlines
* Telecommunications

### Organizational Complexity
“…the amount of complexity derived from the environment where the organisation operates, such as the country, the markets, suppliers, customers and stakeholders; while internal complexity is the amount of complexity that is internal to the organisation itself, i.e. products, technologies, human resources, processes and organisational structure. Therefore,  different aspects compose internal and external complexities.”  

How to deal with external and internal complexity? Nurture it or reduce it?  
Simple rules can keep infrasturcture and processes simple while allowing complex outputs and behaviors.  Lego has five rules:  
1. Does the proposed product ave the Lego look?
2. Will children learn while aving fun?
3. Will parents approve?
4. Does the product maintain high quality standards?
5. Does it stimulate cretivity?

What factors within the economic environment affect businesses?  
Uncertainty and complexity.  

Why do change and shifts and technological developments create both challenges and new opportunities for business?  
Keeping up with technological change is essencial to be competitive in the modern market. However each new technology may not become necessary. There is uncertainty, risk, and cost associated with exploring and embracing technological developments. Implementing the correct ones can provide tremendous gains.  

## 4.3 Organizational Designs and Structures
Identify different types of organizational structures and their strengths and weaknesses.  

Organazional design has a direct impact on an organizations performance.  
Two broad, generalized categories of Organizational Design: **Mechanistic** and **Organic**  

#### Mechanistic
Stable, low uncertainty environment  
* Top-down heirarchy
* Narrow span of control
* Speicalized tasks
* Formal rules
* Vertical communication
* Structured decision-making
 
#### Organic
Unstable, high uncertainty environment  
* Less rigid, horizontal organization
* Rlexible, few rules
* Two-way communication
* Participatory decision-making
* Generalized shared tasks
* Wide span of control

### Types of Organizational Structures
Three eras of evolution of organizational structures in the US.  
**First era** was mid 1800s to late 1790s:
Mechanistic, self-contained, top-down.  
Focus was on organizational process of creating and selling products from raw materials.  
Hierarchial controls with seperate functional specializations.  
Functional structures, then departmental, designed to adapt to external environment and integrate vertically and horizontally.  
**Second era** started in the 1980s-mid 1990s:  
Increased competitions and added complexity in banking, insurance and other industries required faster interactions, leading to a more organic organizational designs and structures.  
Communication required increased speed and integration.  
Computers and networks became part of the organization.  
Introduction of **horizontal organizational design**.  
**Third era** mid-1990s- present:  
Factors include the Internet, global competition, outsourcing of expertise, low wage foreign workers, automated supply chains.  
Increased horizontal and organic structures evolved.  
"Depending on the type of environments from our earlier discussion in which a company operates, the structure should facilitate that organization’s capability to achieve its vision, mission, and goals." - from the text  

Evolving from Mechanistic to Organic, here are six structures:  
1. Functional Structure  
1. Divisional Structure  
1. Geographic Structure  
1. Matrix Structure  
2. Networked Team Structure  
3. Virtual Structure  

#### Functional Structures
Earliest form of organizational structure (industrial revolution).  
Most used design.  
Orgnaized by departments and expertise areas.  
* R&D
* Production
* Accounting
* HR
Pyramid/Top-down Hierarchial controls.  
Popular with small companies and start-ups, government orgnaizations, simple and stable organizations, large organization sub-divisions.  
Pros:  
* Straight forward reporting within departments.  
* Economies of scale.  
* Easy to scale up.  
Cons:  
* Tend to be siloed. Leads to closed mindsets, not open to cross-departmental communications.  
* Lack quick decision-making and coordinating of tasks across departments.  
* Foster competition for power and resources in departmental leadership (as opposed to collaboration and cooportation).  

#### Divisional Structures
Many specialized (functional) departments with a department head.  
Great for organizations with multiple products in different markets.  
Pros:  
* Each area is focused on it's business segmament. Has it's own budget.  
* Clear responsibilities, acountability, expectations.  
* Coordination across products internal departments is more easily facilitated that in a traditional functional structure.  
* Decentralizes decision-making to seperate department heads, etc.  
Cons:  
* Divisions become insular.  
* Poor/infrequent communication and coordination between similar systems across the divisions. 
* Coordination of enterprise mission, direction, values.
* Incompatable systems can evolve.  

#### Geographic structures
**geographic structures** are organized by geographic regions. This keeps the functional verticals near their regional customers, allowing better understanding of their needs, customs, etc.  
Similar to the divisional in terms of the pros and cons. Challenges of communicationa nd coordination over autonomous groups.  

### Matrix structures
Originated in the 1960s. Structured for working with government contracts. Employees have two reporting channels. One to the organization that employs them, and with the organization that hires the services and manages the work they do.  Aerospace firms are credited with being the originators of this, facilitating work with the federal government. But it is applicable when providing services to non-governmental organizations as well.  
Essentially, each vertical (marketing, R&D, engineering, production) has its own manager to report to, but each cross-functional team has a (possibly external) project manager to report to as well.  
Challenges in matrix structures include cross-cultural collaboration, collaboration over distances, divided loyalties, multiple bosses (especially if employees work on multiple projects simultaniously).  

### Networked team structures
Another form of horizontal organization.  
More informal and flexible.  
“Networks have two salient characteristics:
clustering and path length. Clustering refers to the degree to which a network is made up of tightly knit groups while path lengths is a measure of distance—the average number of links separating any two nodes in the network.”  
More organic, network teams form naturally, finding the individuals annd resources necessary to the vision and needs of the mission, unless the organization or leaders withing the organization obstruct this.  
“The networked
organization is one that is connected together by informal networks and the demands of the task, rather than a formal organizational structure. The network organization prioritizes its ‘soft structure’ of relationships, networks, teams, groups and communities rather than reporting lines.”  
Advantages are similar to organic, horizontal and matrix structures.  
Weaknesses:  
* Establishing clear lines of communication.  
* Dependence on technology.  
* No central physical location.  

Clear lines of communication are required to set project goals and deadlines.  
Failing technology (networks, servers) can shut down communication and delay results.  
Without a central physical location can hamper face to face meetings, the conversations that arise organically in a physical office. This can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and late deliverables.  

### Virtual structures and organizations  
Emerged in the 1990s.  
Allow more flexibility.  
Fewer geographical constraints.  
Able to bring together dispersed expertise.  
Boundaryless organization.  
Examples: Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Reebok, Nike, Puma, Dell.  
Advantages:  
* Cost savings  
* Decreased response time.  
* Access to more an diverse labor.  
* 24 hour workday.  
* Less damaging to the environment.  

Disadvantages:  
* Social isolation.  
* Limited communication can lead to lack of trust amoung employees and between employees and the organization.  
* Potentially reduced collaboration.  
  
1. Why does the matrix structure have a dual chain of command?  
The matrix structure provides functional verticals for internal organization and chain of command, and cross-functional horizontals for project based management. Particularly helpful when the organization's expertise is working with outside project management, such as the department of defence, or NASA.  
2. How does a matrix structure increase power struggles or reduce accountability?  
Employees may have split loyalties between their functional department and their project leader. Accountability of individual contributers in cross-functional teams may be for more than their individual deliverables. With two management structures (vertical and horizontal), it may be difficult to assign accountability completely to one individual or one leader.  
3. What are advantages of a formal committee structure? Disadvantages?  
Great question!  

## 4.4 The Internal Organization and External Environments
Explain how organizations organize to meet external market threats and opportunities.  

Theory of the Open Systems, Katz, kahn and Bertalanffy.  
* Inputs
* Throughputs
* Outputs
 
**Inputs**: An organization takes in some kind of resource and/or raw material. This could be information, material, human.  
**Throughputs**: An organizational process changes the input material.  
**Outputs**: An organization returns the changed input to the environment as a product of the throughput stage.  

Organizations are catagorized as Open or Closed (or partially one or the other).  
Closed systems are less sensitive to environmental changes, and so less open to the opportunites there in. As an example, the US auto makers of the 1980, unprepared for the influx of foreign competition (Japan).  
Open systems ar responsive to environmental change, able to adapt. Amazon is an example of an open organization that is open, always adapting to changes in the environment.  
An organization's environment is defined by it's **domain**, the sector or field in which it operates. Examples: marketing, technology, government, financial resources, and human resources.  
Organizations must structure their internal dimensions to be competitive in their markets.  

### McKinsey 7-S Model
A depiction of the internal organization of an organization
Structure, Strategy, Systems, Skills, Style, Staff, all connected to Shared Values.  

Arie Lewin and Carrloo Stephens:  
CEO and top leaders scan external environment, identify uncertainties and resources, then use SWOT analysis (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to establish the organizations domain. Then define vision, mission, goals, strategies. Then establish organizational culture and structure, tec.  

No such alignment with the external environment is perfect or perminent.  

1. Identify the six major organizational structures.  
* functional
* divisioinal
* geographical
* matrix
* network
* virtual

1. Explain the McKinsey 7-S model.  
A way to describe structure within an organization. The seven S's are Structure, Strategy, Systems, Skills, Style, Staff, all connected to Shared Values.  

## 4.5 Corporate Cultures
Identify the fit between organizational cultures and the external environment  

Possibly "...the most important internal dimension of an organization's effectiveness criteria."  
More influential than strategy, it motivates employees "beliefs, behaviors, relationships, and ways they work..." Based on values.  
"first, culture helps an organization adapt to and integrate with its external environment by
adopting the right values to respond to external threats and opportunities; and secondly, culture creates
internal unity by bringing members together so they work more cohesively to achieve common goals."  
Culture is generally created and influences by high level mgmt.  

**Competing Values Framework** (CVF) a well (30+ years) tested model for diagnosing an orgnaization's cultural effectiveness, examining its environmental fit.  
| | Competing | Values | Framework | | 
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| | | Flexiblity | | |
| | Clan | | Adhocracy | |
| Internal focus | | | | External focus |
| | Hierarchy || Market| |
| | Stability | and | Control | |

External focus vs Internal focus  
Flexibility vs stability  
1. Adhocracy Culture: External focus with flexibility. Dynamic/entrepreneurial.  
1. Clan Culture: Internal focus with flexibility. People-oriented/friendly.  
1. Hierarchy Culture: internal focus with stability/control. Process-oriented/structured.  
1. Market Culture: external focus with stability/control. Results-oriented/competitive.  

**Adhocracy Culture**  
Organization emphasizes creating, innovating, visioning the future, managing change, risk-taking, rulebreaking, experimentation, entrepreneurship, and uncertainty.  
**Clan Culture** 
Relationships, team building, commitment, empowering human development, engagement, mentoring, and coaching.  
**Hierarchy Culture**
Efficiency, process and cost control, organizational improvement, technical expertise, precision, problem solving, elimination of errors, logical, cautious and conservative, management and operational analysis, and careful decision-making.  
**Market Culture**
Delivering value, competing, delivering shareholder value, goal achievement, driving and delivering results, speedy decisions, hard driving through barriers, directive, commanding, and getting things done.  

Companies (like Amazon) can have a mix of these cultures.  

1. How can employee diversity give a company a competitive advantage?  

2. Explain the concept of hiring for fit as it relates to corporate culture.  

3. What are some organizational issues that must be addressed when two large firms merge or grow rapidly like Amazon?  
Alignment of culture. Structure of changing organization. Environmental rethink.  

## 4.6 Organizing for Change in the 21st Century
Identify environmental trends, demands, and opportunities facing organizations.  

Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS):
1. persistent inequality and unfairness  
1. domestic and international political tensions  
1. environmental dangers  
1. cyber vulnerabilities.

Complex organizations recomended to use the **nine resilience lens**: Adapt and prosper even facing high impacet, low probability risks (like a global pandemic).  
Three categories:
1. Structural reslilience - internal system dynamics should be loosly coupled (adaptable to change).  
2. Integrative resilience - geographiy and health of individuals, families, neighborhood, cities... etc. Create social capital to help maintain reputation durring challenging times.  
3. Transformitive resilience - mitigate some risk through transformation. Change proactively (or else be changed). Forsight, envirinmental scanning.  

Modern organizations are judged as much on their social impact as on their profitability.
