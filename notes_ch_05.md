# Ethics, Corporate Responsibility, and Sustainability
## Hasbro
Prioritizes corporate social responsibility (CSR)  
Finished #1 in "100 Best Corporate Citizens" by Corporate Responsibility magazine
"...four key areas: product safety, environmental sustainability, human rights and ethical sourcing, and community"  
Product safety is most important.  
Applies standards to all third party manufacturers and across the supply chain.  
Reduces environmental foot print.  

## 5.1 Ethics and Business Ethics Defined
What are ethics and business ethics?

**Ethics**: How we act, live, lead our lives, and treat others.  
**Normative ethics**: How should and outght we live?  
**Business ethics**: Applied ethics focused on the context and environment in which transactions take place. How we apply our ethics in busness.  
Ethics in business has become important after many corporate scandals caused multiple financial disasters, like Enron, Worldcom, the subprime-lending/morgage-derivitive crissis.  
AI, and in particualr Generative AI, is an example of a modern trend that could have negative/ethically questionable impacts on society. Software algorithms can carry biases and negatively impact groups of people, usually minorities.  
Climate change is an ethical issue that many companies do or don't consider. Curbing harmful emissions and considerate use of natural resources can slow or even reverse climate change. Government regulation can help in this, guiding industries to compliance.  
Ethical questions: Who is responsible for preventing criseses and preventing them from reoccuring? Who pays and how much? Who is responsible to protect the common good? What ethical/moral priciples should motivate and guide individuals, groups, society?  
Business schools and NGOs are activly advocating for ethics in business. To achive this requires participation of stakeholders, as well as stockholders.  

1. What individual and organizational ethical issues can we expect to occur?  
Issues around polution, honesty, criminality, greed.  

2. What are some signs of unethical activities you might notice individually and organizationally?  
Doctored records, questionable expenses, large gifts from venders.  

## 5.2 Dimensions of Ethics: The Individual Level
What types of values affect business ethics at the individual level?  

Kenneth Goodpaster and Laura Nash:  
1. Ethics of the System  
2. Ethics of the Organization  
3. Ethics of the Person  

Ethics are typically codified in law and regulations.  Examples:  
* Murder  
* Drunk Driving  
* Robbery  

Some are unwritten societal norms.  
Individual ethics vary from person to person and are influenced by many factors: Religion, family, societal norms, community, peer groups, environment. An individual's ethics impact their decision making in significant ways. For this reason it is important to examine an individuals ethics.  

### Ethics and Values: Terminal and Instrumental Values
The Ethics & Compliance Initiative (ECI) is a research institute dedicated to helping organizations create programs to encourge ethical behavior within their culture.  
An ECI study found 22 percent of workers, globally, felt presure to compromise their ethical standards.  

Emphasising ethics can help organizations of all sizes maintain or restore the trust of the public.  
Most people are unaware of what their ethical values are, as they didn't develop them deliberatly, but as a biproduct of their upbringing and environment. So people often act without thinking through the ethical implications of an action. To be able to think through decision alternatives and recognize the outcomes, good and bad, self awareness is essencial.  
**Terminal values** are desired goals, objectives, desired outcomes.  
Examples: happiness, comfort, security, recognition, adventure.  
**Instrumental values** are behaviors best used to reach the afore mentiond goals (Terminal values).  
Examples: ambition, loveing, forgiveness, honesty, helpful.  
Recognizing and seperating the end from the means can lead to better discusionsand decisions, leading to more ethical actions.  
Terminal goals without clear direction can easily lead to the ethically questionable instrumental value of "The end justifies the means."  
Unrealistic goals can lead to unethical behaviors, which in turn can lead to damage to the organizations reputation, client retention, financial success, etc.  
It is wise to recognize an organizations values, as well as the values of any directives. These two should be aligned.  
Understanding personal values can help direct the individuals decision making.  
Check out the PVA (Personal Values Assessment) found at [https://www.valuescentre.com/our-products/products-individuals/personal-values-assessment-pva](https://www.valuescentre.com/our-products/products-individuals/personal-values-assessment-pva).  

Caroucci's five ways organizations provoke good people to make unethical decisions:  
1. People feel psychologically unsafe to speak up.  
2. Excessive pressure to reach unrealistic performance targets compromises people’s choices.  
3. When individuals face conflicting goals, they feel a sense of unfairness and compromise their reasoning.  
4. Only talking about ethics when there is a scandal.  
5. When there is no positive example available, individuals react instead of choose ethical decisions.  

Questions:  
1. What are terminal and instrumental values?  
Terminal values are goals. Instrumental values are behaviors that lead to those goals.  

2. What are ways organizations can employ values to induce people to make ethical choices?  
Organizational Culture is typically the result of deliberate disemination from decision makers. Leaders can set corporate values that lead to ethical choices.  

## 5.3 Ethical Principles and Responsible Decision-Making
What are major ethical principles that can be used by individuals and organizations?  

Ethical principals are considered permanent, immutable.  
Values are considered personal and subjective, and open to change over time.  
This section considers the following principals:  
* Utilitarianism
* Universalism
* Rights/Legal
* Justice
* Virtue
* Common good
* Ethical relativism

### Utilitarianism: A Consequentialist, "Ends Justifies Means" Approach
Any action is justified if it produces the best outcome for the greatest number of people.  
Actions are morally justifiable if the benefit outweighs the cost.  
This is hard to quantify.  
Frequently used by orgnaizations, usually when there is a scarcity of something (a resource), aka a zero-sum scenerio.  
There is no choice that meets everyone's needs.  

### Universalism: A Duty-Based Approach
Considers the well being of all parties involved and affected by the decision making.  
Compares many options to choose the least harmful.  
Strives to respect individuals and to be fair.  

### Rights: A Moral and Legal Entitlement-Based Approach
**Legal rights** are those cannonized in law.  
**Moral rights** are those based on societal norms and are often considered universal.  
Check out the ["Best Companies to Work For" annual lists](http://fortune.com/best-companies/).  
Also, the "World’s Most Ethical Companies."  

Limitations:  
1. It can be used to disguise and manipulate selfish and unjust political interests.  
2. It is difficult to determine who deserves what when both parties are "right."  
3. Individuals can exaggerate certain entitlements at the expense of others.  

### Justice: Procedures, Compensation, and Retribution
Four major components
1. All individuals should be treated equally.  
2. Justice is served when all persons have equal opportunities and advantages (through their positions and offices) to society's oportunities and burdens  
3. Fair decision practices, procedures, and agreements among parites should be practiced  
4. Punishment is served to someon who has inflicted harm on another, and comnensation is given to those for a past harm or injustice commited against them.  

Questions to ask when weighing a decision:  
1. Is it fair?
2. Is it right?
3. Who gets hurt?
4. How has to pay for the consequences?
5. Do I/we want to assume responsibility for the consequences?

Limitations:  
* Who decides what is "right" and "wrong?"  
* Who decides who has been harmed?
* Who has the moral authority to punish or pay and to whom?  

### Virtue Ethics: Character-Based Virtues
"**Virtue ethics** is based on character traits such as being truthful, practical wisdom, happiness, flourishing, and well-being"  
Focus in on who we should be, not the actions we should take.  
Altruism.  
Virtue often requires practical wisdom.  
Related to Universalism.  
Before acting ask yourself, "What would my best self do?" or perhaps, "What would my grandmother think of this choice?"  

Limitation:  
Who defines "virtuous?"  

### The Common Good
"the sum of those conditions of social life which allow social groups and their individual members relatively thorough and ready access to their own fulfillment."  
Considering the impact of a decision on the overall community, culture, environments.  

Limitation:
Who defines what is "good" for the social, phisical, cultural environment?  

### Ethical Relativism: A Self-Interest Approach
Frequently used, but not a true ethical principle. Only one's own morals should be used to judge the individual.  

Limitations:  
* One is typically blind to ones biases, misinformation, flaws.  
* Leads to absolutism, facism, dictatorships.  
* Allows for abuse of large numbers of the population.  


Principles and values in the work place offer employees stability and direction, and impact job performance and satisfaction. Leadership can use principles and values to influence the culture and motivate and inspire workers.  

1. What are some ethical guidelines individuals and organizations can use to make ethical choices?  
Define principles and values within the organization.  

2. Can being aware of the actual values you use to guide your actions make a difference in your choices?  
Yes. Being aware of the values you use allows you to more honestly weigh the options and outcomes, and make better, more informed decisions.  

## 5.4 Leadership: Ethics at the Organizational Level
Why is ethical leadership important in organizations?  

Organizational leaders set vision, mission, and values that facilitate identifying and implementing strategic and operational alignment within the organization.  
"Leadership is defined as the ability to influence followers to achieve common goals through shared purposes"  
A leaders values generally become the organizations values. They should align with the vision and mission of the organization.  

**Ethisphere** is a private firm evaluating firms' ethical behavior and responsibilities. It uses five criteria:  
1. Evaluates the thics and compliance program.  
2. The extent to which ethics are embedded in it's culture.  
3. Corporate citizenship and responcibility, including environmental impact.  
4. Governance: Whether the CEO also the board chair, and how diverse the board is.  
5. Leadership, Inovation, Reputation.  

### Show Respect for Others
Recognize the worth of others. Treat people as and end in themselves, not as a means. Value people for who they are. Tolerate differences, allow free and independent thought, and persute of personal goals.  

### Treat All Stakeholders Fairly
Ethical leaders treat everyone fairly, justly, equaly. Favoritism creates winners and losers and breeds resentment, with exception for when an individual warents special treatment in order to have a just outcome.  
To prevent winners and losers emerging, everyone must receive equal opportunities, according to their needs, rights, effort, societal contributions, and performance.  

### Work Towards a Common Good
Ethical leaders strive towards a **common good**, something **altruistic** that benefits a greater community, and servers the needs of others.  
Mentoring, empowering and encouraging others, team building, showing concern for the welfare of others, are examples of how to behave in an altruistic manor.  

### Build Community
Ethical leaders do not impose their will on others. They lead by example, work with charities and other organizations and individuals to further their ethical vision. In so doing they can inspire others to work with them for the common goal, noone putting their needs ahead of the common purpose.  

### Be Honest
Honesty requires leaders to be as open as possible. This doesn't mean to tell everything, as that may not lead to a positive outcome. Leaders need to be sensitive to the situation, to the feelings and views and beliefs of others.  
Being transparent (to a point) with stakeholders and shareholders improves trust and protects the organization's reputation.  

### Stewardship and Servant Leadership Styles
**Stewardship**: Empower people to make decsisions.  
Lead without dominating. Care about the followers. Help them succeed individualy as well as professionally.  
Decentralized decision making. All stakeholders have power to effect the organization and it's goals.  

**Servant leadership**: Selfless work with others to achive shared goals that improve the collective welfare. It is the brainchild of Robert K. Greenleaf.  
These are leaders that devote themselves to the greater cause. They are guided by their concience, their moral sense of right and wrong.  
1. Place service before self-interest.  
2. Listen to others.  
3. Inspire through trust.  
4. Work towards feasible goals.  
5. Help others whenever possible.  

## Dark Side of Organizational Leadership
Seven symptons of the failure of ethical leadership:
1. Ethical blindness. Unable to perseive ethical issues.  
2. Ethcal muteness: Do not use ethical language or have ethical principals.  
3. Ethical incoherence: Unaware of inconsistancies between their words and their behaviors.  
4. Ethical paralysis: Unable to act on their values. Frozen by fear of consequences or simply by lack of knowledge (ignorance).  
5. Ethical hypocrisy: Not actually committed to the stated values. Selfishly deligate based on what they don't want or know how to do.  
6. Ethical schizophrenia: The values they claim in the workplace conflict with the values they display outside of the workplace.  
7. Ethical complacency: Belief that they can do no wrong. "When the president does it, then it's not illegal." - Richard Nixon.  

Ethical leadership and organizational culture counts!  
Check out [Fortune’s "“"World’s 19 Most Disappointing Leaders."](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-19-most-disappointing-leaders-130011572.html).  

1. What role does leadership play in how ethically organizations and its members act and perform?  
Leaders set the tone from the top down. A leader is a role-model. Ethical behavior will set the ethical values of the organization's culture.  

2. Explain what stewardship is and the role of servant leadership.  
Stewardship is caring about and empowering people. It is considering the impact of decisions on the greater community and decentralizing the decision making process to give say to all shareholders across the organization.  
Servant leadership is like stewardship, but more passionately committed to the cause. Servant leaders don't need to take credit for successes. They are able to inspire others to serve as well. A servant leader will have a possitive impact on their community and the individuals within.  

## 5.5 Ethics, Corporate Culture, and Compliance
What are the differences between values-based ethics and compliance in organizations?  

Culture is defined by shared values of members, as articulated and practiced by leadership.  
Culture impacts most aspects of an organization internally (strategy, structure, poeple, systems) as well as many aspects externally (reputation, supply lines, marketing).  
Culture is transmitted by:
1. The values and styles that leaders espouse and practice.  
2. The heroes and heroines that the company rewards and holds up as examples.  
3. The rites and symbols that organizations value.  
4. The way that organizational executives and members communicate amoung themselves and with their stakeholders.  

Culture can account for 20-30% of the difference in performance, compared to unremarkable competitors.  
Culture is based in values. Values model and communicate compliance standards.  
* Culture sets assumptions and norms, determining how things get done.  
* Culture helps to identify areas in the business (units, functions, roles) that hold negative perceptions, perhaps feel unwanted preasure, or are unaware of available resources.  
* Culture helps investores and other shareholders believe the company operates ethically.  
* Employees are aware of the conduct, values, and communications of senior leaders.  
* The company regularly surveys employees to get measure their engagement/commitment.  
* Employees are less likely to respond to presures that require compremising on cultural values and are more likely to report misconduct.  
* Employees can percive the ethical priorities of their coworkers, the value of their organization and are willing to share in it.  

### Compliance and Ethics
Carrot and Stick, two necessary elements of an ethcial corporate culture.  
Ethics are a values based approach to motivating apropriate behaviors within the organization.  
Compliance is a rules based approach, backed up by consequences.  
Both are neccessary to motivate proper, ethical and legal behavior within the organization.  

Self-regulation by corporations is always necessary. Because real world events have demonstrated that that on it's own is not enough to prevent organizations from negatively impacting the larger society, governments implement compliance measures in the form of laws, to motivate apropriate behaviors.  

1. In what ways do law and compliance complement ethics in organizations?  
While corporate values motivate ethical behaviors, sometimes they are not enough. Compliance measures, internal to the organization, or exerted externally by government laws and regulations, motivate ethical behavior by corporations and the individuals that make them up.  

2. How does stakeholder management differ from stockholder management?  
Stakeholder management considers the needs of all stakeholders when making decisions and taking actions.  
Stockholder management focuses on maximizing profits for the stockholders.  
The two are not mutually exclusive, especially when considering long term viability and profitability of the corporation.  


## 5.6 Corporate Social Responsibility
What value do CSR (corporate social responsibility) programs offer to organizations and society?  

**Corporate Social Responsibility** (CSR) is a belief that corporations, beyond merely a fiscal responcibility to their shareholders, corporations are part of, and have a role to play in, society and an obligation to make decisions with the best interest of society in mind.  

**The 3 P's**: Profit, the people, and the planet.

**The tripple bottom line** (TBL or 3BL): A measure of businesses accountability in supporting social, environmental, and financial benefits for the greater good.  

CSR is unlikely to solve any significant sociocultural problems, but it does project an ethical culture to stakeholders. There is evidence that this can influence consumer behavior with regard to a companies brand.  
Most executives and many analysts and industry experts believe that well managed CSR does increase a businesses profitability.  

### Stakeholder Management
**Stakeholder management** is the belief that corporations should consider all the relationships that impact the companies performance, and that the companies actions impact.  

### Identifying and Influencing Major Stakeholders
1. Who are the stakeholders?
2. What are their stakes?
3. What do the supporters stand to gain and lose?
4. What do the resisters stand to gain and lose?
5. What type(s) of power do the supporters have?
6. What type(s) of power do the resisters have?
7. What strategies can we use to keep the support of the supporters?
8. What strategies can we use to neutralize or win over the resisters?  

This links to the [Coca Cola](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/stakeholder-engagement) stakeholders approach.  

Studies show CSR and stakeholder management ultimately lead to superior financial performance.  
Companies considered "best corporate citizens" have better reputations and higher profitability.  

1. How do sustainable business practices benefit consumers?  


2. Differentiate the roles compliance and CSR programs serve in organizations. Are these the same, or are there differences? Explain.  
Compliance is rules based, often from external sources like the government, and can carry stipulated penalties.  
CSR is self-regulated, values based behavior. It's reward or pentalties are determined by the impact the organization has on it's stakeholders, and vice-versa.  


## 5.7 Ethics around the Globe
What are ethical issues we encounter in the global environment?

Global organizations face challenges establishing ethical standards because different countries, cultures, and legal and political systems have different norms. Different market systems can also influence values. Corruption can create barriors to ethical behavior as well. For example in some countries payoffs and bribes may be the cultural norm and a cost of doing business, but for U.S. firms the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) forbids this behavior.  

U.S. Firms are encouraged (how?) to add value to the countries they do business in.  Examples:  
* Hiring local labor  
* Creating new jobs  
* Co-venturing with local entrepreneurs and companies  
* Attracting local capital to projects  
* Providing for and enhancing technology transfer  
* Developing particular industry sectors  
* Providing business learning and skills  
* Increasing industrial output and productivity  
* Helping decrease the country’s debt and improve its balance of payments and standard of living.  

### Globalization
**UN Global Compact** for business doing business in least developed countries:  
1. Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights  
2. Ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses  
3. Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining  
4. Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor  
5. Abolish child labor  
6. Eliminate the discrimination of employment and occupation  
7. Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges  
8. Promote greater environmental responsibility through initiatives  
9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies  
10. Work against corruption, including extortion and bribery  

### MNEs Corporate Cultures
Establishing ethical corporate culture abroad is challenging. It must recognize and respect local ethics and values, take a multicultural approach, and employ a diverse workforce.  
**Hanna**'s five strategic questions for organizations doing business abroad.  
1. “What do customers and stakeholders in our market expect from our organization? (Will their standard of living be raised? Will their cultural expectations be violated?)  
2. What is our strategy to be successful in this competitive marketplace? (What can we realistically hope to achieve? What results are we willing to commit to?)  
3. What are our governing values that define how we will work with stakeholders and with each other?  
4. What organizational capabilities do we need in order to achieve these results?  
5. What do our work processes, roles, and systems need to do so that we are consistent with all of the above?”  

Answering these questions should help leaders balance corporate principals and value with local values.  
Diversity and gender-balanced workforces are becoming part of corporate strategy. In part to reduce friction and abuse, and in part because it drives inovation and informs business transformations.  
Characteristics of MNEs:  
* Multicultural values  
* Merit based status  
* Openness to new ideas  
* Excitement about new cultural environments  
* Sensitive to cultural differences  
Social audits can help companies identify their impact and make corrections when necessary.  

1. What ways can and do some MNEs demonstrate social responsibility in foreign countries?  
  Adherance to the UN Global Compact. Social Audits. Multicultural and gender-balaced staffing.  
  
2. What are some specific ethical business practices other countries (besides the United States) and regional governing bodies (such as the European Union) practice and demonstrate with regard to the environment and competition?  
no idea  

## 5.8 Emerging Trends in Ethics, CSR, and Compliance
Identify forecasts about contemporary ethical and corporate social responsibility issues.  

1. #MeToo: People are speaking out about harassment and it is damaging to reputations. Create a corporate culture that encourages employees to speak up when they feel harassed and resolve conflicts as early as possible.  
2. Glassdoor: Social media allows employees to report their take on the corporate environment and often differs from official statements. Culture should allow feedback internally, for the feedback to be taken seriously, and to be acted on.  
3. Natural disasters: These can cause damage to buisinesses as well as people. Put a preparedness plan in place. Test communication systems and employee readiness.  
4. Growth: Growth requires compliance and ethics programs to be in place.  
5. Culture of Compliance: Integrity and ethics are better drivers than punitive measures. How leaders and top performers that break the rules are treated will set the tone for the rest of the orgnization.  
6. Cyber Security: This requires an increased role of compliance based prevention and mitigation.  
7. Whistle-Blowers: Corporations need to resolve issues before they are voiced outside the organization.  
8. Culture and Free Speach: Manage polarizing issues within the organization, ensure fair treatment, protections, etc.  
9. Data Privacy: Adjust business compliance as laws around data privacy arise.  
10. New Networks: Evolve to account for new online networks.  

Ethics and Compliance go hand in hand. Strong cultures create agreement of values amongst stakeholders.  

### Moral Entrepreneur: A New Component of Ethical Leadership
**Moral Entrepreneur**: A person, group, or organization that creates a new moral norm.  
**Ethical Leadership**: Ethical leaders model and communicate "normatively appropriate conduct," suce as openness, honesty, fairness, thoughtfullness.  

1.  What are some emerging national and global issues and trends in ethics and business ethics?  
Multiculturalism, gender-balancing, cultural openness...
