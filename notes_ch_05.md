## 5.1 Ethics and Business Ethics Defined
What are ethics and business ethics?

**Ethics**: How we act, live, lead our lives, and treat others.  
**Normative ethics**: How should and outght we live?  
**Business ethics**: Applied ethics focused on the context and environment in which transactions take place. How we apply our ethics in busness.  
Ethics in business has become important after many corporate scandals caused multiple financial disasters, like Enron, Worldcom, the subprime-lending/morgage-derivitive crissis.  
AI, and in particualr Generative AI, is an example of a modern trend that could have negative/ethically questionable impacts on society. Software algorithms can carry biases and negatively impact groups of people, usually minorities.  
Climate change is an ethical issue that many companies do or don't consider. Curbing harmful emissions and considerate use of natural resources can slow or even reverse climate change. Government regulation can help in this, guiding industries to compliance.  
Ethical questions: Who is responsible for preventing criseses and preventing them from reoccuring? Who pays and how much? Who is responsible to protect the common good? What ethical/moral priciples should motivate and guide individuals, groups, society?  
Business schools and NGOs are activly advocating for ethics in business. To achive this requires participation of stakeholders, as well as stockholders.  

1. What individual and organizational ethical issues can we expect to occur?  
Issues around polution, honesty, criminality, greed.  

2. What are some signs of unethical activities you might notice individually and organizationally?  
Doctored records, questionable expenses, large gifts from venders.  

## 5.2 Dimensions of Ethics: The Individual Level
What types of values affect business ethics at the individual level?  

Kenneth Goodpaster and Laura Nash:  
1. Ethics of the System  
2. Ethics of the Organization  
3. Ethics of the Person  

Ethics are typically codified in law and regulations.  Examples:  
* Murder  
* Drunk Driving  
* Robbery  

Some are unwritten societal norms.  
Individual ethics vary from person to person and are influenced by many factors: Religion, family, societal norms, community, peer groups, environment. An individual's ethics impact their decision making in significant ways. For this reason it is important to examine an individuals ethics.  

### Ethics and Values: Terminal and Instrumental Values
The Ethics & Compliance Initiative (ECI) is a research institute dedicated to helping organizations create programs to encourge ethical behavior within their culture.  
An ECI study found 22 percent of workers, globally, felt presure to compromise their ethical standards.  

Emphasising ethics can help organizations of all sizes maintain or restore the trust of the public.  
Most people are unaware of what their ethical values are, as they didn't develop them deliberatly, but as a biproduct of their upbringing and environment. So people often act without thinking through the ethical implications of an action. To be able to think through decision alternatives and recognize the outcomes, good and bad, self awareness is essencial.  
**Terminal values** are desired goals, objectives, desired outcomes.  
Examples: happiness, comfort, security, recognition, adventure.  
**Instrumental values** are behaviors best used to reach the afore mentiond goals (Terminal values).  
Examples: ambition, loveing, forgiveness, honesty, helpful.  
Recognizing and seperating the end from the means can lead to better discusionsand decisions, leading to more ethical actions.  
Terminal goals without clear direction can easily lead to the ethically questionable instrumental value of "The end justifies the means."  
Unrealistic goals can lead to unethical behaviors, which in turn can lead to damage to the organizations reputation, client retention, financial success, etc.  
It is wise to recognize an organizations values, as well as the values of any directives. These two should be aligned.  
Understanding personal values can help direct the individuals decision making.

Caroucci's five ways organizations provoke good people to make unethical decisions:  
1. People feel psychologically unsafe to speak up.  
2. Excessive pressure to reach unrealistic performance targets compromises people’s choices.  
3. When individuals face conflicting goals, they feel a sense of unfairness and compromise their reasoning.  
4. Only talking about ethics when there is a scandal.  
5. When there is no positive example available, individuals react instead of choose ethical decisions.

1. What are terminal and instrumental values?  
Terminal values are goals. Instrumental values are behaviors that lead to those goals.  

2. What are ways organizations can employ values to induce people to make ethical choices?  
Organizational Culture is typically the result of deliberate disemination from decision makers. Leaders can set corporate values that lead to ethical choices.  

## 5.3 Ethical Principles and Responsible Decision-Making
What are major ethical principles that can be used by individuals and organizations?  

Ethical principals are considered permanent, immutable.  
Values are considered personal and subjective, and open to change over time.  
This section considers the following principals:  
* Utilitarianism
* Universalism
* Rights/Legal
* Justice
* Virtue
* Common good
* Ethical relativism

### Utilitarianism: A Consequentialist, "Ends Justifies Means" Approach
Any action is justified if it produces the best outcome for the greatest number of people.  
Actions are morally justifiable if the benefit outweighs the cost.  
This is hard to quantify.  
Frequently used by orgnaizations, usually when there is a scarcity of something (a resource), aka a zero-sum scenerio.  
There is no choice that meets everyone's needs.  

### Universalism: A Duty-Based Approach
Considers the well being of all parties involved and affected by the decision making.  
Compares many options to choose the least harmful.  
Strives to respect individuals and to be fair.  

### Rights: A Moral and Legal Entitlement-Based Approach
**Legal rights** are those cannonized in law.  
**Moral rights** are those based on societal norms and are often considered universal.

Also, the "World’s Most Ethical Companies."  

Limitations:  
1. It can be used to disguise and manipulate selfish and unjust political interests.  
2. It is difficult to determine who deserves what when both parties are “right.”  
3. Individuals can exaggerate certain entitlements at the expense of others.  

### Justice: Procedures, Compensation, and Retribution
Four major components
1. All individuals should be treated equally.  
2. Justice is served when all persons have equal opportunities and advantages (through their positions and offices) to society'.'s oportunities and burdens  
3. Fair decision practices, procedures, and agreements amont parites should be practiced  
4. Punishment is served to someon who has inflicted harm on another, and comnensation is given to those for a past harm or injustice commited against them.  

Questions to ask when weighing a decision:  
1. Is it fair?
2. Is it right?
3. Who gets hurt?
4. How has to pay for the consequences?
5. Do I/we want to assume responsibility for the consequences?

Limitations:  
* Who decides what is "right" and "wrong?"  
* Who decides who has been harmed?
* Who has the moral authority to punish or pay and to whom?
