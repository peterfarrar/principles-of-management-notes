# Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurs come from all gender, age, and ethnic groups and tend to be single minded. Small businesses make significant contributions to the national and international economy.  

## 7.1 Entrepreneurship
Why do people become entrepreneurs, and what are the different types of entrepreneurs?  

80% (approximately 23.8 million) of the nearly 29.7 million businesses have no employees.  
Only about 19,000 businesses in the United States have more than 500 employees.  

Entrepreneurs are people with vision, drive, and creativity, who are willing to take the risk.  
Woman and minority groups are becoming small business owners at a higher rate than the national average.  

> Here are some questions would-be entrepreneurs should ask themselves:  
> 1. What is new and novel about your idea? Are you solving a problem or unmet need?
> 2. Are there similar products/services out there? If so, what makes yours better?
> 3. Who is your target market? How many people would use your product or service?
> 4. Have you talked with potential customers to get their feedback? Would they buy your product/service?
> 5. What about production costs? How much do you think the market will pay?
> 6. How defensible is the concept? Is there good intellectual property?
> 7. Is this innovation strategic to my business?
> 8. Is the innovation easy to communicate?
> 9. How might this product evolve over time? Would it be possible to expand it into a product line? Can it be updated/enhanced in future versions?
> 10. Where would someone buy this product/service?
> 11. How will the product/service be marketed? What are the costs to sell and market it?
> 12. What are the challenges involved in developing this product/service?

### Entrepreneur or Small-Business Owner?
What's the difference?  
Entrepreneurs are taking a risk to start or change the direction of a small business. They are typically innovators pursuing new products or services. They are visionaries, responsive to changes and trends, and generally take a long term view.  
Small business owners are managers, possibly taking over an existing business, and staying small on purpose.  

### Types of Entrepreneurs
"Entrepreneurs fall into several categories: classic entrepreneurs, multipreneurs, and intrapreneurs."  

#### Classic Entrepreneurs
**Classic Entrepreneurs** are risk takers.  
**Micropreneurs** start a small business and plan to keep it small. These are personal, lifestyle choices (how is this not "just a small business owner" then? The risk factor?).  
**Growth-oriented Entreprenuers** seek growth. They want to build a large, valuble corporation.  

#### Multipreneurs
**Multipreneurs** are entrepreneurs that start a series of companies.  

#### Intrapreneurs
Entrepreneurs that do not own a business, but apply their entrepreneurial skills within another buisiness (typically a large corporation) are called **Intrapreneurs**.  
They have autonomy and funding to pursue their vision, but the security of a regular salary and benefits. There is less risk.  

## Why Become an Entrepreneur?
Reasons to become an entrepreneur include:  
* Enjoying the challenge of starting a new venture.  
* Controling one's own destiny.  
* Financial independance.  
* Freedom from the frustrations of working for another.  
* Feeling satisfaction with their work.
* Creating the personal lifestyle of their choice.

Most entreprenurs say it was worth it and would do it again.  

1. Describe several types of entrepreneurs.  
Mulitpreneurs are serial entrepreneurs that start multiple businesses over time.  
Intrepreneurs are individuals that take their entripreneurial spirit to another business, inovating for typically a large corporation. They find freedom to express their vision without the same risk as an entrepreneur that starts their own business. Intrepreneurs benefit from the financial backing of the organization and the financial security of a salary and benefits.  
Micropreneurs take the risks and share the same visionary nature as other entrepreneurs, but they do not aspire to growth in the same way. Theirs is a personal choice, a lifestyle choice, and their businesses stay small.  

2. What differentiates an entrepreneur from a small-business owner?  
Small business owners typically do not take the same degree of risk. They typically buy or otherwise aquire an existing business and manage it. They stay small.  
Entreprenurs usually aspire to grow (exception 'Micropreneur' mentioned above), and take greater risk. They pursue a vision, often an inovative one, and usually are attuned to change and current trends.  

3. What are some major factors that motivate entrepreneurs to start businesses?  
There are many reasons. To name a few, control of their destiny, freedom from the hassles of working for someone else, they derive satisfaction from the challenges.  

## 7.2 Characteristics of Successful Entrepreneurs
What characteristics do successful entrepreneurs share?  

Being an entrepreneur requires more than a good idea. It requires the ability to create a company to implement the idea, and the drive, perseverance, managerial skills, and technical abilities to make it successful. It is a full time job. "Entreprenurs _are_ the company."  

### The Entrepreneurial Personality
Key traits:  
* Ambitious: They are competitive and have a high need for achievement.
* Independent: They are individualists and self-starters who prefer to lead rather than follow.
* Self-confident: They understand the challenges of starting and operating a business and are decisive and confident in their ability to solve problems.
* Risk-takers: Although they are not averse to risk, most successful entrepreneurs favor business opportunities that carry a moderate degree of risk where they can better control the outcome over highly risky ventures where luck plays a large role.
* Visionary: Their ability to spot trends and act on them sets entrepreneurs apart from small-business owners and managers.
* Creative: To compete with larger firms, entrepreneurs need to have creative product designs, bold marketing strategies, and innovative solutions to managerial problems.
* Energetic: Starting and operating a business takes long hours. Even so, some entrepreneurs start their companies while still employed full-time elsewhere.
* Passionate. Entrepreneurs love their work, as Miho Inagi demonstrated by opening a bagel shop in Tokyo despite the odds against it being a success.
* Committed. Because they are so committed to their companies, entrepreneurs are willing to make personal sacrifices to achieve their goals.  

### Managerial Ability and Technical Knowlege
Beyond the charactersistics of an entrepreneur is business knowledge. Technical knowledge like:  
* Managerial organization
* Operating strategies
* Obtaining finance
* Day to day supervision
Interpersonal and communication skills are important.  
Entrepreneurs eventually learn they can't do everything themselves. They hire and train others, and focus on the parts they are best at.  

1. Describe the personality traits and skills characteristic of successful entrepreneurs.  
Ambitious, independent, confident, creative, visionary, passionate, commited, and skills in management, communication, and business knowledge like how to obtain finances and structure the organization.  

2. What does it mean when we say that an entrepreneur should work on the business, not in it?  
Entrepreneurs need to identify their strengths and focus on doing what they are best at in order to help the business succeed. They can (eventually) hire others to do the other tasks, so they can focus on the business.

### Developing the Business Plan
Developing a **business plan** is one of the most important steps in starting a business. It allows you to identify and evaluate steps and challenges before spending any money. It helps in securing financing, and in identifying risks and make decisions in advance.  
A good business plan should take an objective and critical look at the business idea. Objective analysis can determine the quality of the idea and help with decisions on many aspects of the business. For example, marketing and sales, staffing needs, and milestones can all be identified through analysis and included in the business plan.  
A business plan serves as the intital operating plan for the business.  
Key features:
* General description of the company

### Financing the Business
Financing needs depend of a few factors. How much the entrepreneur is investing of their own capital, projected growth, manufacturing costs to name a few.  
3/4 Inc. 500 companies were funded on $100,000 or less.  
**Debt** is borrowed money that must be repaid.  
**Equity** is monies raise through stock (ownership stake). Tends to be limites to no more than 75% of funding.  
**Angel Investors** and **Venture-Capital Firms** are two sources of equity.  

#### Angel Investors
Angel investors are individuals. They like to get in early. They are cautious with their money because it is their personal capital.  
**Tips on attracting Angel investors**:
* _Show them something they understand_, ideally a business from an industry they’ve been associated with.
* _Know your business details_: Information important to potential investors includes annual sales, gross profit, profit margin, and expenses.
* _Be able to describe your business_—what it does and who it sells to—in _less than a minute_. Limit PowerPoint presentations to 10 slides.
* Angels can always leave their money in the bank, so _an investment must interest them_. It should be something they’re passionate about. And timing is important—knowing when to reach out to an angel can make a huge difference.
* _They need to see management they trust_, respect, and like. Present a competent management team with a strong, experienced leader who can explain the business and answer questions from potential investors with specifics.
* _Angels prefer something they can bring added value to_. Those who invest could be involved with your company for a long time or perhaps take a seat on your board of directors.
* They are more partial to deals that don’t require huge sums of money or additional infusions of angel cash.
* _Emphasize the likely exits_ for investors and _know who the competition is_, why your solution is better, and how you are going to gain market share with an infusion of cash.

#### Venture Capital
Venture capital comes from investment firms (VC firms). They receive an ownership interset and a say in management. They tend to invest later than an angel investor.  

### Buying a Small Business
Although less risky, buying a small business still requires careful, thorough analysis. Know why the owner is selling (problems with business, or personal reasons?). Can the owner provide assistance initially? Are customers loyal to the business, or the previous owner? Consider a non-compete so that clientel doesn't follow the seller to a new, similar busines.  
Prepare a business plan.  

### Risky Business
50% of small businesses fail within the first five years.  
Low sales and High expences are often related to poor management.  
Common causes of closure:  
* Economic factors - downturns, rising interest rates.
* Financial causes - low capital and balances, high expences.
* Lack of experience - inadequate knowlege, experience, expertise.
* Personal reasons - lack of interest, other opportunities, life events.

Early planning (thorough business plan) is important. Business conditions can change. Unexpected challenges can arise. Competitors with deeper pockets or more experience can out perform.  
Stress and the time and commitment can be overwhelming. Slow growth and rapid growth can both create challenges. Rapid response and planning is required to balance them.  
Know when it's failing, minimize personal impact. If you're losing money hand over fist, it may be time to except defeat.  

1. How can potential business owners find new business ideas?  
Ideas are often found while working in a similar or related busines. Entreprenurial and Small Business publications can share trends and ideas. Individuals may have suggestions. Personal experiences may identify needs and opportunites. Hobbies can grow into a business. And more.  

2. Why is it important to develop a business plan? What should such a plan include?  
A business plan is the blueprint for success. It identifies most aspects required to start, run, and finance the business. It acts as an initial operating plan and should be reviewed and revised as such regularly. It is also essencial in securing financing.  

3. What financing options do small-business owners have? What risks do they face?  
There are three basic types of financing. Self financing is when the entrepreneur uses their own savings. Debt is when the entrepreneur borrows funds for the business. And equity is a way to sell partial ownership through stock offerings inorder to raise funds. The latter, using "other peoples money" protects the entrepreneur from some personal responsibility (less financial risk) but also gives some of the decision making power to the investor.


## 7.5 Managing a Small Business
Why does managing a small business present special challenges for the owner?

Small business owners need to solve problems that may arise, and pivot with changes in market conditions. A solid business plan is them most important tool a small business owner can have. It keeps them connected to the core elements of the business (hiring, training, managing, for example).  
Owners need to evaluate performance, recognize changes in market and economic conditions, develop new policies, nurture new ideas, to keep the business growing. Types of skills required change as the business grows, and accordingly, so does the makeup of employees.  

### Using Outside Consultants
Small businesses benefit from using consulting services from specialists. Common examples are accounting and legal services. Other common outsourcing includes IT, marketing, customer service, order fulfillment, payroll, HR. As a company grows, the owner/leadership needs to review these services. At some point it may make sense to bring some or all services in-house.  

### Hiring and Retaining Employees
Hiring employees may be essencial to growth, but comes at an upfront cost. Employees take time and effort to find and train. And their cost is 10-15% above their salary just because of the const of the help-wanted adds, the recriuters, space and taxes. And that's before figuring in the cost of benefits. Be sure to identify those costs up front when making decisions about hiring employees.  
Attracting quality employees requires creativity. The owner can establish an apealing culture: flex time, positivity, comfortable environment, work-life balance. It is important to maintain employee satisfaction if you want to keep quality employees.  

### Going Global with Exporting

Exporting may create increased sales/higher profits. Influences include the price of the dollar, international competition within the US, recession, etc.  
Third parties exist to help (for a price) small businesses with exporting, export trading companies (ETCs) and export management companies (EMCs) can purchase for export and resale, or coordinate the exporting of, a small businesses products.  
Many online resources exist to assist the small busines owner understand challenges invloved in selling abroad:
* The Small Business Association's Office of International Trade.
* The Department of Commerce s Trade Information Center (1-800-USA-TRADE), or its [Export Center(http://www.export.gov)](http://www.export.gov).  

1. How does the small-business owner’s role change over time?
As a company grows, an owners role is expected to move away from the minutia and focus more on long term planning and managing employees.  

2. How does managing a small business contribute to its growth?
Good management is rewarded. Poor decision and management can lead to failure. Examples are financing, hiring practices, planning, planning, planning, outsourcing, setting a cadence to review and revise the business plan/direction of the company.  

3. What are the benefits to small firms of doing business internationally, and what steps can small businesses take to explore their options?
Opportunities may exist in foreign markets. As economic environments change in the U.S., foreign markets may become more or less appealing. Their are online resources, organizations, and third party specialists that can assist the small business owner in evaluating and implementing these opportunites.  

## 7.6 The Large Impact of Small Business
What are the advantages and disadvantages facing owners of small businesses?  

Reasons why small businesses continue to thrive in the United States:
* _Independence and a better lifestyle:_ Large corporations no longer represent job security or offer the fasttrack career opportunities they once did. Mid-career employees leave the corporate world—either voluntarily or as a result of downsizing—in search of the new opportunities that self-employment provides. Many new college and business school graduates shun the corporate world altogether to start their own companies or look for work in smaller firms.
* _Personal satisfaction from work:_ Many small-business owners cite this as one of the primary reasons for starting their companies. They love what they do.
* _Best route to success:_ Business ownership provides greater advancement opportunities for women and minorities, as we will discuss later in this chapter. It also offers  small-business owners the potential for profit.
* _Rapidly changing technology:_ Technology advances and decreased costs provide individuals and small companies with the power to compete in industries that were formerly closed to them.
* _Major corporate restructuring and downsizing:_ These force many employees to look for other jobs or careers. They may also provide the opportunity to buy a business unit that a company no longer wants.
* _Outsourcing:_ As a result of downsizing, corporations may contract with outside firms for services they used to provide in-house. Outsourcing creates opportunities for smaller companies that offer these specialized goods and services.
* _Small businesses are resilient:_ They are able to respond fairly quickly to changing economic conditions by refocusing their operations.

Some cities are better than others for start-ups and entrepreneurs. The text cites:  
* Tulsa, Oklahoma
* Tampa, Florida
* Atlanta, Georgia
* Raleigh, North Carolina
* Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
* Seattle, Washington
* Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Austin, Texas.
(But I bet Portland Oregon is pretty good too. Where can I find a list like this?)  

### Why Stay Small?
Small businesses have an uncomplecated struture that allows them to react quickly to environmental changes, opportunities, and new ideas. They have less staff and structure, so they can operate at a lower cost, and operate more efficiently. They are also better able to fill specialized markets that larger organizations would not be effective at. And can provide a better personalized service than larger organizations.  
Staying small can also present challenges. Managerial competency may be lacking. Securing financing may be more difficult. And the cost of entry may be higher when complying with government regulations. Also, owners may find the long hours draining.  
Finding trustworth, competent employees is crucial to allowing the owner to have free time, and time to grow the business.  

1. Why are small businesses becoming so popular?  
There are many reasons. Technology and outsourcing allow small businesses to succeed in areas that only larger organizations could before. Minorities and woman often find more opportunity and profitability starting a business than working in a larger organization. Corporate entities often downsize, providing less security and opportunity to it's employees than in the past, as well as leading to skilled workers looking for creative ways to gain financial freedom after layoffs. And many people gain personal satisfaction from doing the work they want, doing it for themselves, and in growing a business.  

2. Discuss the major advantages and disadvantages of small businesses.  
Advantages of a small business is it's ability to pivot to changes in the environment, fill specialized and localized roles, create personalized services, and introduce new ideas quickly and efficiently.  
Disadvantages can be a lack of managerial skill from the owner, challenges securing financing, and a higher cost of compliance with government regulations.

### Changing Demographics Create Entrepreneurial Diversity
Boomers are starting twice as many businesses as Millineals.  
Minorities and women are starting more businesses than non-minority men.  

### How Far Will You Go to Get Rich?

Other companies however find that the cost of doing business in those areas slows growth. In 2017 the top regions for venture backed deals were in SF, NYC, Silicon Valley, and New England.

Venture capital financing appears to be trending up. San Francisco, New York City Metro, Silicon Valley, and New England, are the top regions for venture capital deals.  

2. How is entrepreneurial diversity impacting small business and the economy?  
The majority of new small businesses are being created by minorities, women, and older americans. This entrepreneurial diversity is driving the economy forward. 48% of jobs are in small businesses.  

3. How do ethics impact decision-making with small-business owners?  
Every entrepreneur brings with them their personal values. These values set the culture of the organization and play a part in decision making. One example from the text was Guild education. They left San Francisco in part because the cost of doing business there was a drain on resources that could be used to grow the buisness. But in choosing a new location they looked to their values. They wanted a family friendly environment for their employees. They compared that decision to Apple's decision to build a basketball court in their new headquarters, but no daycare center.
