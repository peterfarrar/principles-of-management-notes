## 8.1 Gaining Advantages by Understanding the Competitive Environment
What is strategic analysis, and why do firms need to analyze their competitive environment?  
**Strategic analysis** is the process of studying one's competitive environment so as to understand it's impact on their organization. Awareness of the external, competitive environment allows businesses to adapt and succeed. The **competitive environment** is a both part of the external environment and the internal environment. Who is the competition and what are they doing? Who are your customers? How is the external enviroment changing?  
**Environmental scanning** is the process of examining both the internal and external state of the organization. It alows the organization to position itself for change when needed.  

### The Competitive Environment
**competitive environment** include internal and external components.  
**External factors** are factors that can impact the organizations success. They can not be controlled but must be managed and understood. 
Examples:
* Interest rates
* Natural disasters
* Unemployment

**Internal factors** are the conditions within the organization. To be competitive, an business needs to organize itself structurally, financially, physically, as well as have the correct employee makeup.

1. Why do managers use strategic analysis?  
Strategic analysis is the process of studing one's competitive environment. Competitive environment is both external and internal to the organization.  
Studying the external environment allows managers to identify competitive factors. These can include identifying thier customer base and competition, trends, changes in financial factors like jobs numbers and interest rates, and the unexpected natural disaster, to name a few.  
Studying their internal environment can help them to structure their organzation for success. A business needs to organize itself structurally, financially, physically, as well as have the correct employee makeup. They should be ready to meet the demands of the current environment and be prepared to change as the external competitive environment changes.  

2. How are internal factors different from external factors in a firm’s competitive environment?  
Internal factors are the factors that will allow or prevent an organization for adapting and succeeding in their competitive environment.  
External factors are typically out of the organizations control, but must be accounted for and managed.  

### 8.2 Using SWOT for Strategic Analysis
What is a SWOT analysis, and what can it reveal about a firm?  

* **S**trength
* **W**eakness
* **O**pportunities
* **T**hreats

Strengths and weaknesses are internal to the organization. Opportunites and Threats are external.  

### Strengths
Strengths reveal what an organization is capable of.  

* What is the organization good at?
* How much cash is available?

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses show either what to avoid, or what needs improvement. Sometimes gaps can be filled by a third party.  

* What is the organization _not_ good at?

### Opportunites
Opportunites are situations that the organization has the potential to take advantage of. Knowing its strengths and weaknesses allows an organization to identify opportunites that it can take advantage of, or changes it needs to make in order to do so.  

### Threats
Anything in the external competitive environment that may prevent success. Threats can include changes by competitors, demographics, the economy, to name a few. Assessing and responding to external environmental threats can result in identifying and acting on opportunities.  

### The Limitation of SWOT Analysis
SWOT analysis is limited by the persons doing it. It is easy to miss what can not be imagined.  

1. Explain the elements of a SWOT analysis.  
SWOT is an acronym for **S** trenghs, **W**eaknesses, **O**portunities, and **T**hreats. Strentghts and Weaknesses are aspects of the organizations internal competitive environment, and Opportunities and Weaknesses are aspects of the organizations external competitive environment.  
Strengths are what a company has going for it, resources and what it's good at. Weaknesses are gaps within the organization that can identify what should not be persued, or that needs to change to be successful in those persutes. Opportunites are those elements in the external competitive environment that can be persued for the organizations advantage or profit. And Threats are those elements of the external environment that can work against the organizations success, and must be responded to.  

2. What information does a SWOT analysis provide managers? What information might it miss?  
A SWOT analysis provides the manager with an understanding of the elements of the organizations internal and external competitive environment. This can be used to modify the organizaiton's strucure and make up, and modify the organization's strategy to take advantage of the external environment.  
Internally, strengths identify what an organization is already good at, the weaknesses can identify what an organization should avoid, or where an it needs to change.  
Externally, opportunities identify what an organization can persue, threats can identify what to avoid, but also how to adapt strategy to create opportunites.  
SWOT analysis is not a perfect tool It is limited by the persons doing it. It will miss what those things that that person can not recognize or imagine.  

## 8.3 A Firm's External Macro Environment: PESTEL
What makes up a firm’s external macro environment, and what tools do strategists use to understand it?  

The **External environment** can be seen as everything in the world outside of the organization.  
**Micro environment** includes:  
* Customers
* Competitors
* Suppliers
* Intermediaries
**Macro environment** includes:  
* Sociocultural trends
* Government
* Economy
* Globalization
* Environment
* Demograpics
* Laws
* Technology
Organizations have little direct control over their macro-environment.  

### PESTEL
**PESTEL** is an acronym (like SWOT):
* **P**olitical factors
* **E**conomic factors
* **S**ociocultural factors
* **T**echnological factors
* **E**nvironmental factors
* **L**egal factors  

As with SWOT, different factors in PESTEL can overlap.  
PESTEL doesn't categorize factors as opportunities or threats, but simply acknowledges them as external factors to be interpreted by the organization.  
A threat to one organization can be an opportunity for another, or turned into an opportunity instead of a threat.  

#### Political Factors
* Taxes
* Tarriffs
* Trade Agreements
* Labor Regulations/Unions
* Environmental Regulations

#### Economic Factors
* Employment Rates
* Interest Rates
* Exchange Rates
* Price of Oil  
Theses factors influence an organizations ability to hire quality talent and fund business ventures.  

#### Sociocultural Factors
* Demographic Trends
* Consumer Preferences
* Market Diversity
Possibly the largest range of factors are sociocultural and its subcategories. Demographic trends includes gender, race, age, education, income, wealth...  
Each demographic has it's own preferences.  

#### Technological Factors
* The Internet
* Smartphones
* Connectivity
* Automation
Technological change has forced organizations to adapt or die. Consumer access to information is near ubiquitus.  
Automation has changed the way busniesses and their suppliers, and customer, work together.  
Data travels at the speed of light.  Businesses store and analyse huge amounts of data.  
And much more.  

#### Environmental Factors
* Resources
* Recycling
* Alternative Energy  
Resource scarcity and climate change have termendous impact on business and overlap with sociocultural factors.  

#### Legal Factors
* Contracts
* Laws
* IP Rights
Often overlaps with Political factors, but includes other legal factors that are not political.  

Not all factors fit into one category. Many factors overlap multiple PESTEL categories of factors.  

1. Describe a firm’s macro environment.  
A firms macro-environment are external factors that are generally outside of the organizations direct control. PESTEL is an acronym that helps to break these out into categories that can be analysed and interpreted to help an organization make decisions.  

2. What does PESTEL stand for? How do managers use PESTEL to understand their firm’s macro environment?  
PESTEL is an acronym for external-environmental factors that are generally outside of an organizations direct control. PESTEL stand for Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Evnironmental, and Legal factors. Managers can use this distillation of factors to inform their decision-making. Unlike SWOT, PESTEL doesn't categorize factors as opportunities or threats, but simply acknowledges them as external factors to be interpreted by the organization. Not all factors fit into one category. Many factors overlap multiple PESTEL categories. A threat to one organization can be an opportunity for another, or turned into an opportunity instead of a threat.
