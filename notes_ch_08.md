## 8.1 Gaining Advantages by Understanding the Competitive Environment
What is strategic analysis, and why do firms need to analyze their competitive environment?  
**Strategic analysis** is the process of studying one's competitive environment so as to understand it's impact on their organization. Awareness of the external, competitive environment allows businesses to adapt and succeed. The **competitive environment** is a both part of the external environment and the internal environment. Who is the competition and what are they doing? Who are your customers? How is the external enviroment changing?  
**Environmental scanning** is the process of examining both the internal and external state of the organization. It allows the organization to position itself for change when needed.  

### The Competitive Environment
**competitive environment** include internal and external components.  
**External factors** are factors that can impact the organizations success. They can not be controlled but must be managed and understood. 
Examples:
* Interest rates
* Natural disasters
* Unemployment

**Internal factors** are the conditions within the organization. To be competitive, an business needs to organize itself structurally, financially, physically, as well as have the correct employee makeup.

1. Why do managers use strategic analysis?  
Strategic analysis is the process of studing one's competitive environment. Competitive environment is both external and internal to the organization.  
Studying the external environment allows managers to identify competitive factors. These can include identifying thier customer base and competition, trends, changes in financial factors like jobs numbers and interest rates, and the unexpected natural disaster, to name a few.  
Studying their internal environment can help them to structure their organzation for success. A business needs to organize itself structurally, financially, physically, as well as have the correct employee makeup. They should be ready to meet the demands of the current environment and be prepared to change as the external competitive environment changes.  

2. How are internal factors different from external factors in a firm’s competitive environment?  
Internal factors are the factors that will allow or prevent an organization for adapting and succeeding in their competitive environment.  
External factors are typically out of the organizations control, but must be accounted for and managed.  

### 8.2 Using SWOT for Strategic Analysis
What is a SWOT analysis, and what can it reveal about a firm?  

* **S**trength
* **W**eakness
* **O**pportunities
* **T**hreats

Strengths and weaknesses are internal to the organization. Opportunites and Threats are external.  

### Strengths
Strengths reveal what an organization is capable of.  

* What is the organization good at?
* How much cash is available?

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses show either what to avoid, or what needs improvement. Sometimes gaps can be filled by a third party.  

* What is the organization _not_ good at?

### Opportunites
Opportunites are situations that the organization has the potential to take advantage of. Knowing its strengths and weaknesses allows an organization to identify opportunites that it can take advantage of, or changes it needs to make in order to do so.  

### Threats
Anything in the external competitive environment that may prevent success. Threats can include changes by competitors, demographics, the economy, to name a few. Assessing and responding to external environmental threats can result in identifying and acting on opportunities.  

### The Limitation of SWOT Analysis
SWOT analysis is limited by the persons doing it. It is easy to miss what can not be imagined.  

1. Explain the elements of a SWOT analysis.  
SWOT is an acronym for **S** trenghs, **W**eaknesses, **O**portunities, and **T**hreats. Strentghts and Weaknesses are aspects of the organizations internal competitive environment, and Opportunities and Weaknesses are aspects of the organizations external competitive environment.  
Strengths are what a company has going for it, resources and what it's good at. Weaknesses are gaps within the organization that can identify what should not be persued, or that needs to change to be successful in those persutes. Opportunites are those elements in the external competitive environment that can be persued for the organizations advantage or profit. And Threats are those elements of the external environment that can work against the organizations success, and must be responded to.  

2. What information does a SWOT analysis provide managers? What information might it miss?  
A SWOT analysis provides the manager with an understanding of the elements of the organizations internal and external competitive environment. This can be used to modify the organizaiton's strucure and make up, and modify the organization's strategy to take advantage of the external environment.  
Internally, strengths identify what an organization is already good at, the weaknesses can identify what an organization should avoid, or where an it needs to change.  
Externally, opportunities identify what an organization can persue, threats can identify what to avoid, but also how to adapt strategy to create opportunites.  
SWOT analysis is not a perfect tool It is limited by the persons doing it. It will miss what those things that that person can not recognize or imagine.  

## 8.3 A Firm's External Macro Environment: PESTEL
What makes up a firm’s external macro environment, and what tools do strategists use to understand it?  

The **External environment** can be seen as everything in the world outside of the organization.  
**Micro environment** includes:  
* Customers
* Competitors
* Suppliers
* Intermediaries  

**Macro environment** includes:  
* Sociocultural trends
* Government
* Economy
* Globalization
* Environment
* Demograpics
* Laws
* Technology  

Organizations have little direct control over their macro-environment.  

### PESTEL
**PESTEL** is an acronym (like SWOT):
* **P**olitical factors
* **E**conomic factors
* **S**ociocultural factors
* **T**echnological factors
* **E**nvironmental factors
* **L**egal factors  

As with SWOT, different factors in PESTEL can overlap.  
PESTEL doesn't categorize factors as opportunities or threats, but simply acknowledges them as external factors to be interpreted by the organization.  
A threat to one organization can be an opportunity for another, or turned into an opportunity instead of a threat.  

#### Political Factors
* Taxes
* Tarriffs
* Trade Agreements
* Labor Regulations/Unions
* Environmental Regulations

#### Economic Factors
* Employment Rates
* Interest Rates
* Exchange Rates
* Price of Oil  

Theses factors influence an organizations ability to hire quality talent and fund business ventures.  

#### Sociocultural Factors
* Demographic Trends
* Consumer Preferences
* Market Diversity

Possibly the largest range of factors are sociocultural and its subcategories. Demographic trends includes gender, race, age, education, income, wealth...  
Each demographic has it's own preferences.  

#### Technological Factors
* The Internet
* Smartphones
* Connectivity
* Automation

Technological change has forced organizations to adapt or die. Consumer access to information is near ubiquitus.  
Automation has changed the way busniesses and their suppliers, and customer, work together.  
Data travels at the speed of light.  Businesses store and analyse huge amounts of data.  
And much more.  

#### Environmental Factors
* Resources
* Recycling
* Alternative Energy  

Resource scarcity and climate change have termendous impact on business and overlap with sociocultural factors.  

#### Legal Factors
* Contracts
* Laws
* IP Rights

Often overlaps with Political factors, but includes other legal factors that are not political.  

Not all factors fit into one category. Many factors overlap multiple PESTEL categories of factors.  

1. Describe a firm’s macro environment.  
A firms macro-environment are external factors that are generally outside of the organizations direct control. PESTEL is an acronym that helps to break these out into categories that can be analysed and interpreted to help an organization make decisions.  

1. What does PESTEL stand for? How do managers use PESTEL to understand their firm’s macro environment?  
PESTEL is an acronym for external-environmental factors that are generally outside of an organizations direct control. PESTEL stand for Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors. Managers can use this distillation of factors to inform their decision-making. Unlike SWOT, PESTEL doesn't categorize factors as opportunities or threats, but simply acknowledges them as external factors to be interpreted by the organization. Not all factors fit into one category. Many factors overlap multiple PESTEL categories. A threat to one organization can be an opportunity for another, or turned into an opportunity instead of a threat.  

## 8.4 A Firm's Micro Environment: Porter's Five Forces
What makes up a firm’s external micro environment, and what tools do strategists use to understand it?  

Micro Environment:  
* Competitors
* Intermediaries
* Suppliers
* Customer

A firm must understand its micro-environment in order to be successfull. Firms are part of an **industry**. An industry is a group of firms making similar products or offering similar services. Although firms may not directly compete with each other, they must understand their customers, suppliers, and industry.  
Michael Porter developed **Porter's Five Forces** as a tool to examime groups within the micro-environment and understand its impact on the organization and industry.  

|  |  |  |
| ---  | ---  | --- |
| | Threat of<br />New<br />Entrants |
| Supplier<br />Power | Industry<br />Rivalry | Buyer<br>Power |
| | Threat of<br />Substitutes | |

Analysts determine how each force has a strong or weak impact on the firm.  

### Industry Rivalry
Strong rivalry reduces profit potential for all firms. Weak rivalries have fewer firms and either there are enough customers to sustain each firm, or each firm has specialized in a way to meet a portion of the customer bases' unique needs.  

### The Threat of New Entrants
Profitable markets attract new entrants, either new firms or firms from other industries expanding their offerings by entering new industries. This may be easier or harder based on the **Barriers to entry** (factors that impact a new firms ability to compete successfully). These include cost of entry (equipment, etc.), regulations, brand loyalty.  

### Threat of Substitutes
A substitute is any product or service that can meet the same need for the customer. These are not rivals, but different products or services that can draw away customers.  

## Supplier Power
Supplieres that offer specialized products or control resources or part of a market, can have an upperhand over the firm. Examples include rare earth minerals, specialized computer chips. Suppliers of comodoties like wheat, oil, porkbellies, often have low power, as there are many rivals to choose from.  

## Buyer Power
"Buyer" in this context is the customer that purchases the firms goods or services. In This case the firm becomes the supplier. If the product or service is unique, they can command a higher price. If the goods and services provided are commonly available, then the firm will have to set competitive prices, and so has less power. Some firms use **switching costs** to penalize consumers if they chose to change supliers. The harder it is to change to the competitors offering, the more power the firm has.  

1. Describe each of Porter’s Five Forces. What information does each provide a manager trying to understand her firm’s micro environment?  
The  five forces are:
* Industry Rivalry - More rivals reduces profits because there are many options. Fewer rivals reduces options, and increases profits for the firm.  
* The Threat of New Entrants - profitable industries can attract more players. These can create more rivalries and reduce profits. Barriers of entry, including higher cost of entry and government regulations, can inhibit other entities from entering the industry.  
* Threat of Substitutions - Products from a different industry might be able to be used to substitute for a firms offerings at a lower cost. An example might be, if everyone decides to make their own sandwiches, Subway Sandwiches would have reduced profits. The key is for the firm to make their product more appealing than the substitute. For example, a premade product is fast and easy and requires no knowledge of how to create the substitute. Subway makes the sandwich for you.  
* Supplier Power - If a supplier has control over limited or unique resources or product, their power is high and they can charge higher amounts for their goods. If their products are readily available, like comodities like pork and beans, their power is low and their cost reflects this.  
* Buyer Power - In this relationship the firm becomes the supplier to the buyer. If the industry is full of rival firms, the buyer has many choices and can demand a lower price, and vice versa. Firms can implement "switching costs" to make choosing a different firm's product more expensive or difficult for the buyer in order to reduce the buyer's power. Examples are litterally charges, like a cell phone provider might use if a customer terminates a contract early, to technilogical challenges, like compatibility issues between the firm and rival firm's devices.  

## 8.5 The Internal Environment
How and why do managers conduct an internal analysis of their firms?  

The **Internal Environment** includes employees, investors, and assets.  

### Resources and Capabilities
**Resources** are what an organization has. This includes people, equiptment, facilities, cash, etc.  
**Capabilities** are what an organization offers. This includes goods and services, anything that can create value for a customer.  

### The Value Chain
The **Value Chain** is a series of steps that an organization follows to create a product that the customer will pay for. The value of the product should increase with each step.  
**Primary activities** are the steps the organization takes to create the product.  
**Support activities** are steps the organization takes that are not directly part of the products creation, but support the organization's ability to create products.  

### Using Resources and Capabilities to Build an Advantage over Rivals
Resources and Capacities should be considered assets that can seperate an organization from its competetors.  

### **Using VRIO
**VRIO** is an analytical tool use to assess resources and capabilities. It is an acronym and stands for **v**alue, **r**arity, **i**mitation, and **o**rganization.  
**V**alue: does the resource or capability generate value for the organization?  
**R**are: Is the resource or capacisty unique or unusual within the industry?  
**I**mitate: Is this difficult for competitors to imitate?  
**O**rganization: Is the organization organized in a way that can take advantage of this resource or capability to generate value?  

1. What are firm resources and capabilities?  
Resources are what an organization has. This includes people, equiptment, facilities, cash, etc.  
Capabilities are what an organization offers. This includes goods and services, anything that can create value for a customer.  

3. Describe a value chain and what the activities in the chain represent.  

4. What is VRIO? What questions do the letters stand for, and how does using VRIO help a manager make decisions?  

## 8.6 Competition, Strategy, and Competitive Advantage
What does it mean to compete with other firms in a business environment, what does it mean when a firm has a competitive advantage over its rivals, and what generic strategies can a firm implement to gain advantage over its rivals?  

Firms exist in a competitive environment. They use strategy to seek a competitive advantage.  

### Competition
A firm has a competitive advantage over its rivals when it has more customers, generates more profit, and provides more value to its shareholders.  
A firm can use PESTEL to evaluate its external environment and VRIO to evaluate its resources and capabilities. These tools can help it to gain a competitive advantage.  

### Generic Business-Level Competitive Strategies
Michal Porter's three **generic business-level strategies** outline methods of organizing to compete in a product market. These are **cost-leadership**, **differentiation**, and **focus**.  

#### Cost Leadership
Cost leadership means charging less that competitors for the same product. This can be achived by reducing costs throught the value chain. Managing costs from suppliers, finding the lowest costing labor markets, automating as much as possible are some ways in which a cost leader can spend as little as possible on its products so as to gain profit while offering the lowest price.  

#### Differentiation
Differentiation is the opposite of cost-leadership. Instead of reducing costs throughout the value chain, the firm adds value at each step. Instead of lowering the cost of the final product, the cost is raised. The strategy is to provide a higher quality product to a market willing and able to pay more for it.  

#### Focus
Focus means creating a high quality product specific to a small market. The firm puts its efforts into marketing its specialized product to customers who are willing to pay a high enough price that the firm can maintain profitability.  

### Strategic Groups
**Strategic groups** are competitors offering similar products and using the same generic strategy. Organizations do not typically compete against other organizations using a different generic strategy or offering different products.  

1. What is competition, and what is the role of strategy in competition?  

2. When does a firm have a competitive advantage over its rivals?  

3. Explain the differences between the three business-level generic competitive strategies.  

## 8.7 Strategic Positioning
What elements go into determining a firm’s strategic position?  

Using the analysis tools discussed in this chapter, a manager can gain an understanding of their competitive and macro environment, resources and capabilities, and state of their industry to make decisions about their **strategic position**. A strategic position includes choosing a generic strategy, geographical and consumer markets, and finding something to set itself apart (something that makes it unique).  

1. How does strategic analysis help a firm develop its own strategic position?  
Strategic analysis helps a firm identify it's competitive and macro environment, resources and capabilities, and state of their industry. This knowledge informs what strategy and markets to persue.
