## 11.1 An Introduction to Human Resource Management
What has been the evolution of human resource management (HRM) over the years, and what is the current value it provides to an organization?  

HR From the Outside In describes HR evolution in "waves".  
* Wave 1 - HR Administration: Focus on basic HR duties and services like regulatory compliance, employee attendance, recruitment, salaries, pension administration.  
* Wave 2 - HR Practices: Developing inovative practices in compensation, learning, communication, and sourceing.  
* Wave 3 - HR Strategy: Integrating HR strategy with the businesses strategy. Letting business strategy drive HR decisions and planning, and including HR in the business strategy process.  
* Wave 4 - HR Outside In: Future facing, assessing the environment, developing stakeholder perceptions (in particular the organizations reputation) and investor confidence.  

HR's primary responcibilites are in managing the employee life cycle, from recruiting, hiring, onboarding, developing, reviewing, compensating, promoting, terminating.  

1. How has the function of human resource management evolved over the years?  
HR has become more sophisticated over time. Originally an administrative role, HR is now integrated with company strategy internally and externally.  

2. In what way do you usually interact with human resources?  
Initial calls when starting the interview process. orientation, layoffs.  

## 11.2 Human Resource Mangement and Compliance
How does the human resources compliance role of HR add value to an organization?  

The _Age Discrimination in Employment Act_ protects people over fourty from age discrimination. This covers all employment terms, such as hiring, firing, salary, etc.  

The _Americans with Disabilities Act_ protects people from being descriminated against based on disablities. This applies to anyone who has or is percieved to have a mental or physical limitation. Employers are required to make accommodations for these individuals unless doing so presents an "undue hardship."  

The _Fair Labor Standards Act_ establishes a number of standards around employing people including age, pay, record keeping.  

The _Family and Medical Leave Act_ protects an employee from being terminated if they need to take up to 12 weeks off within a one year span to address a family and/or medical issue. There are exceptions for smaller employers.  

The _National Labor Relations Act_ protects the rights of private-sector employees to organize, form unions, and collectively bargin with employers.  

The _Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act_ requires employers of 100 or more employees to provide sixty days notice ahead of large layoffs. This doesn't apply to most public employers.  

For more information on compliance, the [Society for Human Resources](https://www.shrm.org/) is a good resource.  

Laws change frequently and HR professionals must stay up to date on compliance regulations. They also may need to educate managers so that they can make informed decisions with regards to their employees.  

HR should provide an up-to-date employee handbook clarifying all company policies and procedures.  

Regular HR audits can protect against damage to the organization's reputation, and financial repercusions that can result from noncompliance.  

1. What are some of the key regulations that guide the compliance work of human resource management?  
* Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
* Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
* Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
* National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
* Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN)  

2. What does an employee handbook provide to an organization?  
The employee handbook lays out policies and procedures to ensure the organization is in compliance with regulations.  

## 11.3 Performance Management
How do performance management practices impact company performance?  

HR is responsible for creating the performance management process. It becomes managers responsibility to implement it, communicating individual and organizational performance goals.  
Initially a tool to drive accountability and appraise managers, it is now part of the employee development strategy.  

Forced-ranking is a system of dividing employees into groups of high achievers, low achievers, and everybody else. High achievers are promoted to senior positions, low achievers are let go.  
Problems with this approach include:  
* Judging on performance, not potential.
* Negatively fosters competition that undermines collaboration and teamwork.  

Many executives believe performance management doesn't drive higher performance, and focuses on past performance. Efforts are being made to change this, looking for more agile processes that focus on future performance. Deloitte Services has four true-or-false questions that it asks it's managers:  
1. Given what I know of this person’s performance, and if it were my money, I would award this person the highest possible compensation increase and bonus.
1. Given what I know of this person’s performance, I would always want him or her on my team.
1. This person is at risk for low performance.
1. This person is ready for promotion today.  

Challenges to be addressed:  
* Align individuals and company goals. Employees tend to set goals that relate to their work, rather than the businesses goals. Business goals can be complex and difficult for an employee to understand and align with. And those goals can change often and rapidly.  
* Reward performance. Rewarding performance must be based on the performance management process.  
* Identifying poor performers is challenging. The performance management process doesn't seem to be good at this. Managers often don't address poor performance outside of the annual review process.  
* Avoid legal problems. Real time communication and documentation can help protect the organization from legal issues.  

1. Where did the concept of performance management originate?  
The US Military in WWI.

2. What are some of the key challenges of any performance management process?  
* Aligning individual and company goals
* Rewarding performance
* Identifying poor performers  
* Avoiding legal problems  

## 11.4 Influencing Employee Performance and Motivation
How do companies use rewards strategies to influence employee performance and motivation?  

Companies use performance and reward systems to motivate employees.  
**Reward Systems** are frameworks organizations create to  motivate employees to perform at a high level. High performing employees are rewarded some form of compensation to keep them motivated. Most organizations use a **pay-for-performance** approach, which rewards high performing, impactful employees competitively.  

Stephen Miller, _Study: Pay for Performance Pays Off_:
* Recognize and reward high performers (46.9%)
* Increase the likelihood of achieving corporate goals (32.5%)
* Improve productivity (7.8%)
* Move away from an entitlement culture (7.8%)  

Half of high performing companies pay for performance, recognizing, and rewarding their top performers. Lower performing organizations tended to focus on corporate goals.  

HR is responsible for designing, implementing, communicating the pay-for-performance program. Important elements are:  
1. define the pay philosopy. Get leadership's cultural buy in on paying top performers more.  
2. Analize the impacts and costs.  
3. Review existing pay policies and make necessary adjustments. Identify and correct gaps before implementing the program.  
4. Adjust compensation process to align with new program. Formalize the pay increases and bonuses and how they tie to performance.  
5. Communicate changes in philosophy to the managers and employees. Integrate this into the organizations culture.  

Compensation is a key piece of the total rewards that HR professionals use in the rewards process. _World at Work_ defines six elements that make up the total rewards:  
* Compensation
* Benefits
* Work-life effectiveness
* Recognition
* Performance management
* Talent development

The August 2008 HBR article “Employee Motivation: A Powerful New Model” identifies four drivers underlying motivation. They are  to acquire, bond, comprehend, and defend.  
The drive to acquire goods that affect our well being. Addresses how we compare ourselves to others and what more we want. Some say we are insatiable. Best addressed by compensation.  
The drive to bond with individules, organizations, cultures, and more. Pride at being connected to something, part of something. Best addressed by corporate culture.  
The drive to comprehend the world around us. Motivated to figure things out and contributing. Best addressed by job design.  
The drive to defend ourselves, families, friends, etc. Defensive against external threats. Also, resistance to change. Best addressed by performance management and resource allocation.  

Compensation and reward systems are extremely complicated. Compensation, total rewards, and drives are factors in creating a successsful one.  

1. What does a pay-for-performance strategy mean for a company?  
Pay-for-performance is a reward strategy that identifies and rewards high performing employees. This in turn motivates employees to perform at a higher level and to have more impact on the companies success. Stephen Miller's article "Study: Pay for Perfomrance Pays Off" shows research confirming that pay-for-performance strategies that differenciate and reward high performers improves the likelyhood of achieving the companies goals (by as much as 32.5%).  

2. What is the first step in defining an organization’s pay-for-performance strategy?  
Define the pay philosophy and get leadership buy-in.  

## 11.5 Building an Organization for the Future
What is talent acquisition, and how can it create a competitive advantage for a company?  

**Talent acquisition** involves defineing a strategy to select, recruit, and hire talent. Unfortunately this is often a reactive process to fill vacant roles when employees leave.  
In the 2009 HBR article, _The Definitive Guide to Recruiting in Good Times and Bad_, Boris Groysberg, Nitin Nohria, and Claudio Fernández-Aráoz list seven actions for a successful recruiting strategy.  
1. Anticipate the Need
1. Specify the Job
1. Develop the Pool
1. Assess the Candidates
1. Close the Deal
1. Integrate the Newcomer
1. Audit and Review

While many pieces of the talent acquisition process may be outsoursed, there must be an internal team or individual to develop the strategic plan.  
High level leadership positions must not remain unfilled for too long, as it presents a risk to the success of the business. Selecting the right person for these roles is more difficult as the talent pool is smaller and the impact on the organization is greater than with lower level employees.  

### Best practices
**Anticipate the Need**  
Based on the organization's strategic plan some things to determine are:
* What the future structure of the organization will be?
* What positions will need to be filled?
* What development will internal candidates need?  

**Specify the Job**  
For each role, answer the questions like:
* What skills and competencies will be required for a given role?
* How will they fit into the existing internal environment?
* What kind of support will the organization need to supply to help the new hire to succeed?  

**Develop the Pool**  
Develop a succession plan and cast a wide net. Before the hiring process even begins, develop a pool of potential candidates. Communicate with many contacts, including customers, suppliers, board members, employees. Consider internal candidates, former employees, and individuals that have worked closely with trusted members of the organization. When it's time to move forward, identify the top 10-12 candidates.   

**Assess the Candidates**  
Get the right people involved in the interview process. Keep the number small, like 3. Typically this would be the HR manager, the hiring manager, and the hiring managers boss.  
The best interviewers will be knowledgable about the needs of the role being filled, have high emotional intelligence, and unbiased.  
Interview questions should be behavioral, questions about past experiences that ressemble situations expected to be encountered in the role.  
Following the interviews, the interviewers should meet and discuss the candidates. Use metrics for specific qualities. Reach a concensus on one to three candidates.  
Check references. Good references include a former boss, a former peer, a former report or mentee.  
Involve a small number of key, unbiased stakeholders in the process. Let them review the necessary competencies for the role and the candidates assessments before meeting with the candidate.  
Finally, the three interviewers meet again to review feed back from the stakeholders and discuss the final candidate. The hiring manager should always make the final decision.  

**Close the Deal**  
Demonstrate commitment to and interest in the candidate. This can include a personal commitment by the CEO. Communicate an understanding of their motivations, goals, etc.  
Communicate clearly the challenges and opportunities of the position and how it differs from other companies, competitors.  
It is recomended that the hiring manager be involved in the final stages of the hiring process, as it conveys commitment and respect.  
Present an appropriate compensation package. This should be carefully balanced to appeal to the candidate without negatively impacting current employees that may learn the details.  

**Integrate the Newcomer**  
It is important to integrate the new hire into the organization. Assigning a mentor who can assimilate the new hire into the culture and provide feedback. HR, the hiring manager, and the mentor should check in regularly for the first few months, and quarterly for the first year. During these checkins, insure the new hire is making progress and getting the following:  
* The support they need
* Developing the right relationships
* Understanding the business  

Developing a detailed integration plan can help with this.  

**Audit and Review**  
Despite the best practices, it is still possible to hire the wrong candidate. If the candidate demonstrates ineptitude, it is in the organization's best interest to release them.  
It can help to keep track of the other top candidates, and assess how they are fairing in their new roles (assumption being they have new roles). Comparisons there can help determine if the assessments that led to the new hire were effective in choosing the best candidate. It can also identify the best assessors for future recruitment.  

The talent acquisition program is a key part of HR's role. The right talent give an organization a competitive advantage.  

1. What are some best practices for recruiting and hiring leadership candidates?  

* Anticipate the Need
* Specify the Job
* Develop the Pool
* Assess the Candidates
* Close the Deal
* Integrate the Newcomer
* Audit and Review  

1. How can we ensure a more successful integration of the new hire?  
Provide mentorship and regular checkins with management and HR for the first few months, and quarterly checkins for the first year.  

## 11.6 Talent Development and Succession Planning
What are the benefits of talent development and succession planning?  

**Talent development** is assessing and developing internal talent.  
**Succession planning** is reviewing important roles and identifying internal and external candidates that can fill or be developed to fill them when they become vacant.  
These are both HR responsibilities that rely heavily on feedback and buy-in from management.  

Performance is an evaluation of how an employee has performed in their current role, meeting goals, demonstrating competencies, etc.  
Potential is an evaluation of how an employee could advance within the organization. This does not mean their competency in their current work. It asks whether the employee is capable and willing to advance.  

Measuring potential is challenging. Managers look for competencies like people and leadership skills, business acumen, technology and learning skills, and strategic thinking. Their past performance, behavior, education, accomplishments, and interest in advancement are all considered.  

In a talent review, managers use a nine-box grid to evaluate their reports across two axes, a performance axis and a potential axis. The performance axis is a evaluation of the employees past performance. The potential axis is an evaluation of the employees future potential. Each axis has three ranks, high, medium, low.
For the talent review session, managers bring their nine-box ratings and presents them to the rest of the management team. Other participants can way in on employees they've interacted with. In the talent review session, it is important to have objective definitions of what performance and potetial mean within the organization. At the end of the session the ratings are used to determine outputs of an action plan for each employee, identifying high-potential employess, identifying gaps in talent, and other input that can be used in succession planning.  

1. What is the difference between the performance and potential categories used in the talent review?  
Performance is about the past. Potential is about the future.  

2. What roles should an organization discuss as part of the succession planning process?  
A business should have a business plan that includes which roles are critical, which roles will become vacant or be created in the future, who can fill those roles from within and how much time would they need to be prepared, as well as which roles need to be filled externally.
