## 13.1 The Nature of Leadership
What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?  

Leadership is a social process, creating and sharing a vision that the can bring members of the group together to attain their goals.  

## Leader versus Manger
To be a good manager, one must be a good leader.  

A manager is responsible for the administrative role of planning organizing, directing.  
A leader influences the people needed to fulfill the goals set out by the manager.  

A manager is appointed to the role.  
Leaders are also appointed, but based on their ability to get buy-in. One could say, circumstances reveal an individual as a leader.  

Extrinsic: Managers power comes from their title and the power the organization gives that title. The manager has power because their reports are subordinate to them.  
Intrinsic: Leaders power comes more from their relationships and their perception. How people view a leader is how he is able to lead. The leader has power because people want to give it to them.  

Effective leadership requires managment ability. Effective management requires leadership.  

1. What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?  
Leadership is the ability to direct groups to attain their mutual goals through social influence. Through their relationships and reputation, leaders build buy-in. People give them their power because they want to.

## 13.2 The Leadership Process
What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?  

Key components to the working relationahip that is the leadership process:  
1. the leader
2. the followers
3. the context
4. the leadership process
5. the consequences  

### The Leader
The people that orchestrate the group activities to achive its goals.  

### The Follower
The follower is an active participant. Their needs are part of what the leader must fulfill in order to lead. They give the leader power (or reject them) to achive the goals.  
For a leader to be effective they must understand the personalities of the followers. Some people respond better to authoritarian leadership, some prefer a participatorial approach.  
People with low self esteem may need a supportive environment, whereas other people are more self confident and self motivated. People less commited or motivated may require more direct and directive leadership.  

### The Context
The context is the environment in which the leaders and followers exist. This can refer to location, complexity and clairty of the goal, interpersonal relationships within the organization, energy levels, level of consensus, etc.  

### The Process
This is the working relationship between leader and followers. The leader influences the followers and the followers influence the leader. Everyone influences and is influenced by the context.  

### The Consequences
Outcomes. Success means that the groups needs have been met, and the goals (or tasks) have been achived.  

Leadership is about the relationships between the leader and the followers. "The quality of the relationship is reflected by the degree of mutual trust, loyalty, support, respect, and obligation."  

1. What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?  
The processes associated with people coming to leadership positions have five componants:
1. the leader
2. the followers
3. the context
4. the leadership process
5. the consequences  
These componants interact with and influence each other. The successful leader orchestrates these interactions to accomplish the goals of the organization. The process is the development of two way working relationships over time, cultivated to match the individual personalities of the followers. All the members of the group influence, are influenced by, and are part of the context in which goals are defined and outcomes (consequences) achived.  

## 13.3 Types of Leaders and leader Emergence
How do leaders influence and move their followers to action?  

A **Formal Leader** is recognized and appointed by the organization. Typically managers are formal leaders.  
An **Informal Leader** is not offically recognized by the organization, but is recognized as such by the other members of the group. Informal leaders do not typically perform all of the same duties as the manager, such as planning, organizing, directing, etc.  

### Paths to Leadership
**Desingated leaders** are formally groomed for the role, while **emergent leaders** appear dynamically during the process of achiving the groups goals.  
Emergent leaders gain their power and influence by posessing the knowledge, skills, abilities, expertise that the organization needs to succeed. What those are changes over time as the environment changes. Emergent leaders become leader because the other members of the group ceed power to them. Therefore, they are typically respected within the group. Members do not ceed power to people they deem unworthy, unethical, dishonest, ignorant or lazy.  

### Leadership as an Exercise of Influence
A leaders power comes from their ability to influence others behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, that is, their social influence.  

In the late 1950s, John R. P. French Jr. and Bertram Raven developed the [Five Bases of Power model](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Power/French_&_Raven_Studies_Social_Power_ch9_pp150-167.pdf). They are:  
_Reward power_ - Power granted because of the perception that a person can grand rewards like power, money, fame.  
_Coercive power_ - Power granted because of the perception that a person can punish by means like physical, emotional, financial.  
_Referent power_ - Power granted a person because of the perception that it is beneficial to be associated or approved by them.  
_Expert power_ - Power granted because of the perception that the person possesses and may share knowledge or expertise that is needed.  
_Legitimate power_ - Power granted by the perception that the person has a right to have power over others. Exaples include legal title (king, policeman), organizational title (manager, director), personal qualities (apperance, charisma), and rationality (evidence based, reasoned).  

Coercive power can alienate those that do not comply.  
Reward power can become equative. Followers can compare what they get directly to what they are willing to sacrafice.  
Referent power can create a strong connection by the follower to the leader.  
Expert power can create a strong commitment to the leader's goals.  

It is belived that referent and expert power create the most effective and consistant results because the followers form a strong connection either to the identity of the leader or the commitment to the leader's goals.
Coercive, reward, and legitimate power are belived to be inconsistant. Legitimate power is considered more effective when based in rationality than when it is based in title or position.  

Successful leaders develop multiple sources of power.  

"Language, ritual, drama, myths, symbolic constructions, and stories are some of the tools leaders use to capture the attention of their “followers to be” to evoke emotion and to manage the meaning “of the task (challenges) facing the group."  

### Influenced-Based Leadership Styles
In mechanistic organizations employees expect to be given direction and are willing to follow instructions. In more organic organizations employees expect to be participants in decision making. In these cases leadership can use power to exert influence.  

#### The Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum
Tannenbaum and Schmit defined the spectrum of managemnt influence from _autocratic_, through various levels of _participative_, to _free-rein_.  

#### Theory X and Theory Y Leaders
Theory X assumes workers are generally unhappy, unfocussed, and lack self-control. Theory X managers are highly controlling (autocratic).  
Theory Y assumes workers are creative, self-directed and have self-control. Theory Y managers are open to and may encourage or even expect employee involvement in the decision making process, and give employees autonomy to do their work.  

#### Directive/Permissive Leadership Styles
Jan P. Muczyk and Bernard C. Reimann of Cleveland State University  
Four leadership styles derived from two axes, Amount of Employee Participation in Decision-Making and Amount of Leadership Direction.

<center>

| |Low Employee<br />Participation | High Employee<br />Participation |
|--|--|--|
| High Amount of<br />Leader Direction | Directive Autocrat | Directive Democrat | 
| Low Amount of<br />Leader Direction | Permissive Autocrat | Permissive Democrat | 
| | |

</center>

**Directive Autocrat**: Useful when leaders need to make quick decisions, or in circumstances where they are the expert and their reports lack the know how to act without direction.  
**Permissive Autocrat**: Useful when reports have the skills and experience necessary to complete (often routine) tasks without direct instruction.  
**Directive Democrat**: Useful when reports add value with ideas and decision making, but the leader will make the actual final decision or actions.  
**Permissive Democrat**: Useful when reports are able to highly competent, self manage their time, and when the group is able to make positive decisions. Leaders can act more as a facilitator, relationship manager, coach, mentor, etc.  

1. What is the role of the leader and follower in the leadership process?  
A leader is responcible for orchistrating followers to accomplish the organizations goals. This is carried out in many ways.
The follower is an active and willing participant with a range of possible involvement in the decision-making process. Ultimately the follower helps the leader achive their vision.  

2. How do the theories of Tannenbaum and Schmidt’s leadership continuum and McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y attempt to define leadership?  
Both define leadership styles in terms of the freedom employees have to make decisions and cary out their tasks. T & S provide a spectrum of control, where as X and Y contrast a belief in the ability of the employee to succeed without firm direction.  

## 13.4 The Trait Approach to Leadership
What are the trait perspectives on leadership?  

The **great man theory of leadership** is that some people are born with what it takes to be a great leader. The idea of a great man can be seen as the start of the study of leadership. The _trait approach to leadership_ is the study of leaders to identify their traits and so identify people with these traits for leadership positions.  

### Leader Trait Research
Ralph Stogdill's catagories of characters studied:  
* Physiological
* Demographic
* Personality
* Intellective
* Task-related
* Social  

"The [successful] leader is characterized by a strong drive for responsibility and task completion, vigor and persistence in pursuit of goals, venturesomeness and originality in problem solving, drive to exercise initiative in social situations, self-confidence and sense of personal identity, willingness to accept consequences of decision and action, readiness to absorb interpersonal stress, willingness to tolerate frustration and delay, ability to influence other person’s behavior, and capacity to structure social interaction systems to the purpose at hand." - Ralph Stogdill  

Edwin Locke's Core traits demonstrating leadership potential:  
1. Drive: A high level of energy, effort, ambition.
2. Leadership motivation: A desire to lead.
3. Honesty and integrity: Truthfulness and alignment between words and actions.
4. Self-confidence: Self assured in one's self, ideas, and abilities.
5. Cognitive ability: Posessing good judgement and able to think analytically, strategically, and multidimensionally.
6. Knowledge of the business: posessing an understanding of the company, industry, and related knowledge.
7. Other traits: Intangibles like charisma, creativity, and adaptability.

Locke belives people with these traits have great leadership potential and that these traits attract followers.  

Psycologist Walter Mischel describes behavior as a function of the individual and the situation they are in. In what he calls strong situations personality is suppressed, whereas in weak situations the personality is aloud to express itself. We can equate "strong" to "mechanistic" organizations, and "weak" to "organic" organizations.  
So a person posessing leadership traits may be so constrained in a mechanistic organization that they are unable to express their nature, and their abilities would remain unrecognized. In an organic organization the same person would be more likely able to demonstrait and be recognized for their leadership qualities.  

There does not appear to be a great deal of support for the idea that great leaders are born that way. While genetics does appear to influence some of the necessary qualities, like intelligence and disposition, life experience apears to determine what is expressed and what is suppressed. And many traits appear (honesty, self-confidence) to be mostly or entirely a product of the environment.  

### Other Leader Traits
#### Sex and Gender Role
It can be observed that men emerge as leaders more often that women. However it appears that it is less about the actual sex of the individual as it is about the gender traits. While posessing "feminine" traits does not appear to detract from leadership ability, traditional "masculine" personality traits (Assertivness, agressivness, competitiveness, stubornness) are characteristic of people in leadership roles.  
There does appear to be differences in leadership styles based in gender. Males lean towards autocratic styles, while females lean towards democratic styles. That is, women tend to focus on participation and the needs of the group, where as men tend to focus on tasks and the organizational goals.  

#### Dispositional Trait
Leaders with a positive mood are more socially competent, able to contribute better in group situations, and are generally more successful in the leadership role. Followers pick up on the positivity and become more productive and commited to the organization and its goals.  

#### Self-Monitoring
Self-monitoring is the act of adjusting personal presentation and so the way they are persived in order to effect the situation productively and positively. They do this, at least in part, by monitoring social queues. Basically this is emotional intelligence in practice. It is observed that individuals skilled in self-monitoring have a greater likelyhood of emerging as leaders.  

1. What are the trait perspectives on leadership?  

the trait theory of leadership believes that people posessing certain traits are more likely to become leaders. Some categories of these traits are:
* Demographic
* Personality
* Intellective
* Task-related
* Social

Edwin Locke's Core traits demonstrating leadership potential:  
1. Drive: A high level of energy, effort, ambition.
2. Leadership motivation: A desire to lead.
3. Honesty and integrity: Truthfulness and alignment between words and actions.
4. Self-confidence: Self assured in one's self, ideas, and abilities.
5. Cognitive ability: Posessing good judgement and able to think analytically, strategically, and multidimensionally.
6. Knowledge of the business: posessing an understanding of the company, industry, and related knowledge.
7. Other traits: Intangibles like charisma, creativity, and adaptability.

Locke belives people with these traits have great leadership potential and that these traits attract followers. 

## 13.5 Behavioral Approaches to Leadership
What are the behavioral perspectives on leadership?  

_Moving from traits to behaviors._  

### The Ohio State University Studies
Ralph Stogdill's researchers identified two key sets of behaviors in good leaders, consideration and initiatin structure.  
**Consideration** refers to a relationship oriented set of behaviors: recognizing them, being supportive, friendly, communicative, representing the interests of his team members, respecting their ideas and their feelings.  
**Initiating structure** refers to the task oriented set of behaviors: identifying, planning, and scheduling the work that needs to be done and providing direction to accomplish it, solving problems, coordinating resources, setting performance standards and proceedures.  

These two sets of behaviors are not part of a binary choice. They can be effectively used together.   

These categories distinguish leaders from one another. However their impact was inconsistant across organizations. The implication was that not all situations react the same way to a given leadership style.  

### The University of Michigan Studies
At about the same time as Stogdill's research, similar research was underway at the University of Michigan. And they found two similar sets of behaviors.  
They identified **Employee-member-centered** behaviors that correlated closely with the consideration behaviors from Ohio State university, and **job-centered** behaviors that correlated closely with the initiating structures behaviors. The U of M study's findings corrolating so closely with the OSU findings lend credibility to eachother.  

### The Leadership Grid®
Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton developed the Leadership Grid (also known as the Managerial Grid) as a way to classify styles of leadership. They rank two axes from 1 (low) to 9 (high), Concern for People and Concern for Production. Five basic breakdowns of this tool are:
1,1: Indifferent (aka Impoverished). Managers have low concern for accomplishing tasks and little concern for the well being of the employee.  
9,1: Controlling (aka Task management). Managers focus on results and have little concern for the well being of the employee. This corrolates well with McGregor's Theory X.  
5,5: Status Quo (aka Middle of the road). Managers try to strike an equal balance between people and production. Neither need is met.  
1,9: Accomodating (aka Country club). Managers focus entire on the needs of the employee. The expectation is that this will motivate employees to perform at a high level. Generally, it is accepted that it doesn't.  
9,9: Sound (aka Team). Managers focus heavily on both the people and the product. Employees are empowered and trusted to perform. This correlates well with McGregor's Theory Y.  

Initially Blake and Mouton believed 9,9 was the superior management style. However it's been shown that while this style is excellent for organizations where job-centered leadership is needed, organizations with highly compenent employees do not require a high level of concern for production.  

1. What are the behavioral approaches to defining leadership?
Generalizing OSU and U of M studies, and Blake and Moutons leadership grid, the two sets of behaviors found to define leadership are employee-centric and production-centric. These can be combined, as described by the leadership grid.

2. What roles do gender and the popular perceptions of gender roles have on views of leadership traits?
Successful leaders generally demonstrate masculine gender role traits like self-confidence, assertivness, agressivness, competitiveness, stubornness (uncompromising). Feminine traits tend to focus on participation and the needs of the group. While masculine traits are considered necessary, feminine traits do not detract from a leaders ability to be successful.  

## 13.6 Situational (Contingency) Approaches to Leadership
What are the situational perspectives on leadership?  

"The qualities, characteristics, and skills required in a leader are determined to a large extent by the demands of the situation in which he is to function as a leader." - Ralph Stogdill 1948  

A leadership style leads to different outcomes based on the situation.  

### Fiedler's Contingency Model
Fred E. Fielder, University of Washington  
**Contingency theory of leadership** states that organizations must identify a leaders trait (apparently their are only two?) and match them to the proper situation.  

#### The Leader's Trait
THe least-preferred coworker (LPC) score is determined by examining a leaders description of their LPC. A description using positive terms (pleasant, friendly, intelligent) results in a high score and indicates a _relationship oriented_ leadership style. A description using negative terms (unpleasant, unfriendly, unintelligent) results in a low score and indicates a _task-oriented_ leadership style.  

#### The Situatinal Factor
**Situational favorableness/situational control** describes a leaders ability to control and influence a group to achive the desired outcomes. This is measured by degrees of three factors:  
*  leader-member relations: The group accepts the leader, work well with them, and are loyal to them.  
*  task structure: The leader presents specific, detailed tasks, unambiguous goals, and a plan to achive them.  
*  position power: The leader is able to influence the group.  

#### Leader-Situation Matches
Fielder belived it is easier for an organization to shape the situation to match the leaders style than for a leader to change his style to match the situation.  

<table style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th />
    <th style="text-align: center" colspan=3>Favorable</th>
    <th style="text-align: center" colspan=2>Moderate</th>
    <th style="text-align: center" colspan=3>Unfavorable</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <th />
    <th style="text-align: center">1</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">2</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">3</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">4</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">5</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">6</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">7</th>
    <th style="text-align: center">8</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Leader-Member Relations</td>
    <td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>Good</td><td>Poor</td><td>Poor</td><td>Poor</td><td>Poor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Task Structure</td>
    <td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leader Position Power</td>
    <td>Strong</td><td>Weak</td><td>Strong</td><td>Weak</td><td>Strong</td><td>Weak</td><td>Strong</td><td>Weak</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Relationship-oriented styles do best in moderate situations.  
Task-oriented styles do best in both favorable and unfavorable situations.  
Leaders with middle range LPC scores can be used in a wider range of situations.  

#### Controversy over the Theory
Although widely accepted, criticisms include contradictory findings in the field, and a failure for Fiedler to explain the connection between a leaders attitude (LPC) and their behaviors.  

### Path-Goal Theory
Robert J. House and Martin Evans, University of Toronto  
Like Fiedler's theory, **path-goal theory of leadership** believes leadership styles should be matched to situations. House and Evans focused on _observable behavior_. This means that changes in behavior can adapt leaders to different situations, as well as Fiedler's idea to structure situations to match leadership traits.  

To be an effective leader, _the goal_ is defined, and _the path_ is the clear instruction from the leader on how to achieve the goal. Team members are rewarded for following the path and achiving the goal with something that they value (money, recognition, promotion). Leaders also provide support, clearing barriers, providing resources and coaching.  

#### An Appropriate Match
1. Analize the situation     
2. Identify and use the correct leadership style  

#### Behavior Dimensions
1. _Supportive ledership_: Concerned with the needs of the members.  
1. _Directive leadership_: Defines rules and procedures, goals and expectations.  
1. _Participatative leadership_: Consults and includes ideas and definition from expert employees.  
1. _Achievement-oriented leadership_: Sets goals, challenges employees, demonstraits confidence in the employees abilities to succeed.  

## Cross-Cultural Context
Westerners have a romantic view of successful leaders as larger than life heros.  
Understanding effective leadership styles across cultures is still developing. Some indication is that styles that empower subordinants is not welcomed or effective in countries like india, where as it is often linked with higher employee satisfaction in the North America and Europe.  

1. Identify and describe the variables presented in Fiedler’s theory of leadership.  
_Situational favorableness/situational control_ describes a leaders ability to control and influence a group to achive the desired outcomes. This is measured by degrees of three factors:  
_leader-member relations_: The group accepts the leader, work well with them, and are loyal to them.  
_task structure_: The leader presents specific, detailed tasks, unambiguous goals, and a plan to achive them.  
_position power_: The leader is able to influence the group.  

2. What are the leadership behaviors in the path-goal theory of leadership?  
_Supportive ledership_: Concerned with the needs of the members.  
_Directive leadership_: Defines rules and procedures, goals and expectations.  
_Participatative leadership_: Consults and includes ideas and definition from expert employees.  
_Achievement-oriented leadership_: Sets goals, challenges employees, demonstraits confidence in the employees abilities to succeed.  

3. What role does culture have in how leadership is viewed?  
Understanding effective leadership styles across cultures is still developing. Some indication is that styles that empower subordinants is not welcomed or effective in countries like india, where as it is often linked with higher employee satisfaction in the North America and Europe.

4. What are the differences between the trait, behavioral, and situational approaches to defining leadership?  
_Traits_ refer to a qualities that the leader posesses: Honesty, self-confidence, charisma.
_Behavioral_ refers to actions that the leader takes: Supportive, directional, task-oriented.
_Situational_ refers to factors in the team: highly skilled employees, low self-esteem, motivated.  

# 13.7 Substitues for and Neutralizers of Leadership
What does the concept “substitute for leadership” mean?  

_Substitutes_ for leadership include when staff doesn't need supervision, motivation, etc. or when tasks are so clearly defined that no leader is needed to define them.  
_Neutralizers_ are anything that gets in the way of the leader using their influence, for example a lack of organizational support, or organizationl or contractual limitations.  
An employees _focus of attention_ is the state and trait of focusing on the job and the leader. The state is the moment of focus, the trait is the propensity to do so.  

_Aside_: Managers manage processes, leaders lead people.  

1. Identify and describe substitutes of leadership.  
A highly motivated employee substitues for a leaders need to motivate. A highly skilled and experienced employee substitutes for a leaders need to define tasks.  

# 13.8 Transformational, Visionary, and Charismatic Leadership  
What are the characteristics of transactional, transformational, and charismatic leadership?  

## The Transformational and Visionary Leader
**Transformational leaders** are agents of change. They inspire using values, visions, mission. They question the status quo and motivate folowers. Sometimes they are called **visionary leaders** because they influence through dreams of what can be. They give actions meaning. They are charismatic.  

## Charismatic Leadership
A **charismatic leader**'s power is their personality. They form strong relationships with their followers. Their primary base power (from French and Raven's five power bases) is referent power. They are self-confident and have a strong drive for power.  

1. What are the defining characteristics of transformational and charismatic leaders?  
They inspire using values, visions, mission. They question the status quo and motivate folowers. Sometimes they are called "visionary leaders" because they influence through dreams of what can be. They give actions meaning. They are charismatic. Their power is their personality. They form strong relationships with their followers. Their primary base power (from French and Raven's five power bases) is referent power. They are self-confident and have a strong drive for power.

13.9 Leadership Needs in the 21st Century
How do different approaches and styles of leadership impact what is needed now?  

The past couple of decades have been marked by rapid change and extreme competition. The future looks to have more of this.  
The leaders of the future will need these qualities:  
* strategicly opportunistic
* globally aware
* capable of managing a highly decentralized
* organization
* sensitive to diversity
* interpersonally competent
* organizational community builders  

Contingency models, traits, and behaviors do not form the complete picture of a leader. More theories are evolving. Some of these are: leader-member exchange theory, implicit leadership theory, neocharismatic theory, value-based theory of leadership, and visionary leadership.  

1. What is the role of leadership in the 21st century?
To be the kind of visionary that can guide organizations forward to new opportunities, through new challenges, in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment.
