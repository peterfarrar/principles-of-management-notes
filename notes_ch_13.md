## 13.1 The Nature of Leadership
What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?  

Leadership is a social process, creating and sharing a vision that the can bring members of the group together to attain their goals.  

## Leader versus Manger
To be a good manager, one must be a good leader.  

A manager is responsible for the administrative role of planning organizing, directing.  
A leader influences the people needed to fulfill the goals set out by the manager.  

A manager is appointed to the role.  
Leaders are also appointed, but based on their ability to get buy-in. One could say, circumstances reveal an individual as a leader.  

Intrinsic: Managers power comes from their title and the power the organization gives that title. The manager has power because their reports are subordinate to them.  
Extrinsic: Leaders power comes more from their relationships and their perception. How people view a leader is how he is able to lead. The leader has power because people want to give it to them.  

Effective leadership requires managment ability. Effective management requires leadership.  

1. What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?  
Leadership is the ability to direct groups to attain their mutual goals through social influence. Through their relationships and reputation, leaders build buy-in. People give them their power because they want to.

## 13.2 The Leadership Process
What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?  

Key components to the working relationahip that is the leadership process:  
1. the leader
2. the followers
3. the context
4. the leadership process
5. the consequences  

### The Leader
The people that orchestrate the group activities to achive its goals.  

### The Follower
The follower is an active participant. Their needs are part of what the leader must fulfill in order to lead. They give the leader power (or reject them) to achive the goals.  
For a leader to be effective they must understand the personalities of the followers. Some people respond better to authoritarian leadership, some prefer a participatorial approach.  
People with high low self esteem may need a supportive environment, whereas other people are more self confident and self motivated. People less commited or motivated may require more direct and directive leadership.  

### The Context
The context is the environment in which the leaders and followers exist. This can refer to location, complexity and clairty of the goal, interpersonal relationships within the organization, energy levels, level of consensus, etc.  

### The Process
This is the working relationship between leader and followers. The leader influences the followers and the followers influence the leader. Everyone influences and is influenced by the context.  

### The Consequences
Outcomes. Success means that the groups needs have been met, and the goals (or tasks) have been achived.  

Leadership is about the relationships between the leader and the followers. "The quality of the relationship is reflected by the degree of mutual trust, loyalty, support, respect, and obligation."  

1. What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?  
The processes associated with people coming to leadership positions have five componants:
1. the leader
2. the followers
3. the context
4. the leadership process
5. the consequences  
These componants interact with and influence each other. The successful leader orchestrates these interactions to accomplish the goals of the organization. The process is the development of two way working relationships over time, cultivated to match the individual personalities of the followers. All the members of the group influence, are influenced by, and are part of the context in which goals are defined and outcomes (consequences) achived.  

## 13.3 Types of Leaders and leader Emergence
How do leaders influence and move their followers to action?  

A **Formal Leader** is recognized and appointed by the organization. Typically managers are formal leaders.  
An **Informal Leader** is not offically recognized by the organization, but is recognized as such by the other members of the group. Informal leaders do not typically perform all of the same duties as the manager, such as planning, organizing, directing, etc.  

### Paths to Leadership
**Desingated leaders** are formally groomed for the role, while **emergent leaders** appear dynamically during the process of achiving the groups goals.  
Emergent leaders gain their power and influence by posessing the knowledge, skills, abilities, expertise that the organization needs to succeed. What those are changes over time as the environment changes. Emergent leaders become leader because the other members of the group ceed power to them. Therefore, they are typically respected within the group. Members to not ceed power to people they deem unworthy, unethical, dishonest, ignorant or lazy.  

### Leadership as an Exercise of Influence
A leaders power comes from their ability to influence others behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, that is, their social influence.  

In the late 1950s, John R. P. French Jr. and Bertram Raven developed the [Five Bases of Power model](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Power/French_&_Raven_Studies_Social_Power_ch9_pp150-167.pdf). They are:  
_Reward power_ - Power granted because of the perception that a person can grand rewards like power, money, fame.  
_Coercive power_ - Power granted because of the perceptin that a person can punish by means like physical, emotional, financial.  
_Referent power_ - Power granted a person because of the perception that it is beneficial to be associated or approved by them.  
_Expert power_ - Power granted because of the perception that the person possesses and may share knowledge or expertise that is needed.  
_Legitimate power_ - Power granted by the perception that the person has a right to have power over others. Exaples include legal title (king, policeman), organizational title (manager, director), personal qualities (apperance, charisma), and rationality (evidence based, reasoned).  

Coercive power can alienate those that do not comply.  
Reward power can become equative. Followers can compare what they get directly to what they are willing to sacrafice.  
Referent power can create a strong connection by the follower to the leader.  
Expert power can create a strong commitment to the leader's goals.  

It is belived that referent and expert power create the most effective and consistant results because the followers form a strong connection either to the identity of the leader or the commitment to the leader's goals.
Coercive, reward, and legitimate power are belived to be inconsistant. Legitimate power is considered more effective when based in rationality than when it is based in title or position.  

Successful leaders develop multiple sources of power.  

"Language, ritual, drama, myths, symbolic constructions, and stories are some of the tools leaders use to capture the attention of their “followers to be” to evoke emotion and to manage the meaning “of the task (challenges) facing the group."  

### Influenced-Based Leadership Styles
In mechanistic organizations employees expect to be given direction and are willing to follow instructions. In more organic organizations employees expect to be participants in decision making. In these cases leadership can use power to exert influence.  

#### The Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum
Tannenbaum and Schmit defined the spectrum of managemnt influence from _autocratic_, through various levels of _participative_, to _free-rein_.  

#### Theory X and Theory Y Leaders
Theory X assumes workers are generally unhappy, unfocussed, and lack self-control. Theory X managers are highly controlling (autocratic).  
Theory Y assumes workers are creative, self-directed and have self-control. Theory Y managers are open to and may encourage or even expect employee involvement in the decision making process, and give employees autonomy to do their work.  

#### Directive/Permissive Leadership Styles
Jan P. Muczyk and Bernard C. Reimann of Cleveland State University  
Four leadership styles derived from two axes, Amount of Employee Participation in Decision-Making and Amount of Leadership Direction.

<center>

| |Low Employee<br />Participation | High Employee<br />Participation |
|--|--|--|
| High Amount of<br />Leader Direction | Directive Autocrat | Directive Democrat | 
| Low Amount of<br />Leader Direction | Permissive Autocrat | Permissive Democrat | 
| | |

</center>

**Directive Autocrat**: Useful when leaders need to make quick decisions, or in circumstances where they are the expert and their reports lack the know how to act without direction.  
**Permissive Autocrat**: Useful when reports have the skills and experience necessary to complete (often routine) tasks without direct instruction.  
**Directive Democrat**: Useful when reports add value with ideas and decision making, but the leader will make the actual final decision or actions.  
**Permissive Democrat**: Useful when reports are able to highly competent, self manage their time, and when the group is able to make positive decisions. Leaders can act more as a facilitator, relationship manager, coach, mentor, etc.  

1. What is the role of the leader and follower in the leadership process?  
A leader is responcible for orchistrating followers to accomplish the organizations goals. This is carried out in many ways.
The follower is an active and willing participant with a range of possible involvement in the decision-making process. Ultimately the follower helps the leader achive their vision.  

2. How do the theories of Tannenbaum and Schmidt’s leadership continuum and McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y attempt to define leadership?  
Both define leadership styles in terms of the freedom employees have to make decisions and cary out their tasks. T & S provide a spectrum of control, where as X and Y contrast a belief in the ability of the employee to succeed without firm direction.  

## 13.4 The Trait Approach to Leadership
What are the trait perspectives on leadership?  

The **great man theory of leadership** is that some people are born with what it takes to be a great leader. The idea of a great man can be seen as the start of the study of leadership. The _trait approach to leadership_ is the study of leaders to identify their traits and so identify people with these traits for leadership positions.  

### Leader Trait Research
Ralph Stogdill's catagories of characters studied:  
* Physiological
* Demographic
* Personality
* Intellective
* Task-related
* Social  

"The [successful] leader is characterized by a strong drive for responsibility and task completion, vigor and persistence in pursuit of goals, venturesomeness and originality in problem solving, drive to exercise initiative in social situations, self-confidence and sense of personal identity, willingness to accept consequences of decision and action, readiness to absorb interpersonal stress, willingness to tolerate frustration and delay, ability to influence other person’s behavior, and capacity to structure social interaction systems to the purpose at hand." - Ralph Stogdill  

Edwin Locke's Core traits demonstrating leadership potential:  
1. Drive: A high level of energy, effort, ambition.
2. Leadership motivation: A desire to lead.
3. Honesty and integrity: Truthfulness and alignment between words and actions.
4. Self-confidence: Self assured in one's self, ideas, and abilities.
5. Cognitive ability: Posessing good judgement and able to think analytically, strategically, and multidimensionally.
6. Knowledge of the business: posessing an understanding of the company, industry, and related knowledge.
7. Other traits: Intangibles like charisma, creativity, and adaptability.

Locke belives people with these traits have great leadership potential and that these traits attract followers.  

Psycologist Walter Mischel describes behavior as a function of the individual and the situation they are in. In what he calls strong situations personality is suppressed, whereas in weak situations the personality is aloud to express itself. We can equate "strong" to "mechanistic" organizations, and "weak" to "organic" organizations.  
So a person posessing leadership traits may be so constrained in a mechanistic organization that they are unable to express their nature, and their abilities would remain unrecognized. In an organic organization the same person would be more likely able to demonstrait and be recognized for their leadership qualities.  

There does not appear to be a great deal of support for the idea that great leaders are born that way. While genetics does appear to influence some of the necessary qualities, like intelligence and disposition, life experience apears to determine what is expressed and what is suppressed. And many traits appear (honesty, self-confidence) to be mostly or entirely a product of the environment.  

### Other Leader Traits
#### Sex and Gender Role
It can be observed that men emerge as leaders more often that women. However it appears that it is less about the actual sex of the individual as it is about the gender traits. While posessing "feminine" traits does not appear to detract from leadership ability, traditional "masculine" personality traits (Assertivness, agressivness, competitiveness, stubornness) are characteristic of people in leadership roles.  
There does appear to be differences in leadership styles based in gender. Males lean towards autocratic styles, while females lean towards democratic styles. That is, women tend to focus on participatino and the needs of the group, where as men tend to focus on tasks and the organizational goals.  

#### Dispositional Trait
Leaders with a positive mood are more socially competent, able to contribute better in group situations, and are generally more successful in the leadership role. Followers pick up on the positivity and become more productive and commited to the organization and its goals.  

#### Self-Monitoring
Self-monitoring is the act of adjusting personal presentation and so the way they are persived in order to effect the situation productively and positively. They do this, at least in part, by monitoring social queues. Basically this is emotional intelligence in practice. It is observed that individuals skilled in self-monitoring have a greater likelyhood of emerging as leaders.
