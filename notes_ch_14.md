14.1 Motivation: Direction and Intensity
Define motivation and distinguish direction and intensity of motivation.  

**Ability** is defined as a combination of knowledge, skill, and receptiveness to learning: What you know, what you are adept at doing, and how well you can learn more.  
**Role perception** is defined as how well one understands their role (job) in the organization. The better understood, the more capable one is of meeting expectations.  
The **performance environment** is defined as environmental factors that impact an individuals performance. For examples are poor quality equipment, high levels of stress, a lack of nutrition will all interfere with ones ability to perform at peak potential.  
**Motivation** is defined as internal or external force or forces that "energize, direct, and sustain human behavior." Internal examples are values, goals, needs. External examples are reward, punishment, encouragement.  
**Work motivation** is defined as the amount of work a person will put in to achiveing a desired level of performance. To reach the goal one might, for example, put in more effort learning or practicing a skill, and sacrifice time spend socializing.  

Employers want motivated employees. "“What motivates people to perform
well?"  

Two major components of Motivation:  
**Direction**: A goal that a person wants to achive and a plan to do so.  
**Intensity**: The amout of effort a person is willing and able to exhert to reach their goal.  
_If either of these is lacking, success is unlikely._  

Employees might have _intensity_, but because they have an inacurate _role perception_ they lack the correct direction to succeed. Management can assist by clarifying direction and so providing a more accurate _role perception_ for their employee.  

There are many theories of motivation. Two categories of motivational theory are _content motivatin_ and _process motivation_.  
**Content motivation** focuses on _what_ motivates people.  
**Process motivation** focuses on _how_ people are motivated.  

1. Explain the two drivers of motivation: direction and intensity.  
**Direction**: A goal that a person wants to achive and a plan to do so.  
**Intensity**: The amout of effort a person is willing and able to exhert to reach their goal.  

2. What are the differences between content and process theories of motivation?  
**Content motivation** focuses on _what_ motivates people.  
**Process motivation** focuses on _how_ people are motivated.  

3. Will there ever be a grand theory of motivation?  
Probably not.  

## 14.2 Content Theories of Motivation
Describe a content theory of motivation.  

Content theory focuses on needs. A **need** is something that is lacking: food, sex, shelter, recognition, love. A **manifest need** is the current energized need.  

### Manifest Needs Theory
By the 1920's, behvioral scientists had identified around 6000 needs.  
Menry A. Murray condensed the list into categories of instinctive and learned needs. He called these **primary needs** and **secondary needs**.  
_Primary needs_: Instinctive, physiological needs like food, drink, sex, defication.  
_Secondary needs_: Learned needs like recognition, affiliation, love.  
Murry believes people have many needs, but express only a few at any given time. Expressed needs are **manifest needs**. His theory is called _The Manifest Needs Theory_. Needs not currently being expressed are called **latent needs**. Latent needs may not need to be expressed at a given time, or may not be able to be expressed because of the environemnt.  

### Learned Needs Theory
David C. McClelland built on the Manafest Needs Theory for 50 years. He and his team focused on three specific needs:  
* The need for achievement (nAch)
* The need for affiliation (nAff)
* The need for power (nPow)  

McClelland believed that although these needs are primarily learned in childhood, they can be taught, especially the need for achievement.  

#### Need for Achievement
The first of McClelland's learned needs.  
A **motive** is the source of motivation. When a person expresses _nAch_ and works hard to succeed they are said to have a _high achievement motive_.  
Three major characteristics of high-nAch people:  
1. Feeling responsible to complete assigned tasks.  
2. Prefer situations with a moderate possiblity to succeed.  
3. Have a strong desire for feedback, good or bad, on their performance.  

Organization's rely on their employees nAch levels. This is especially true for roles requiring self-motivation and management positions. High nAch people require less supervision, and so allow modern companies to be light weight and spend less on management.  
It is also important that organizations recognize and manage their employees needs to achive. Overly simple or complex tasks demotivate and lead to under achivement.  

#### Need for Affiliation
The second of McClelland's learned needs.  
High nAff people have a strong desire to build positive relationships with other people. They perform better where teamwork is required and are demotivated in isolated roles. Low nAff people shouldn't be thought of as disliking others, they simply don't put as much effort into establishing and maintaining friendly relationships.  

#### Need for Power
The third of McClelland's learned needs.  
These people have a need to control people and things. There are "two faces of the need for power":  
_The personal power seeker_ seeks to control others for the sake of controlling others. They want to be dominant. Their motivation is in the best interest of themselves, not the organization.  
_The social power seeker_ seeks to influence others in a positive way, and in the interest of the organization. They satisfy their power needs by stearing a team towards a successful outcome. McClelland belives this is the best kind of person for a managerial role. It is important that they are able to satisfy their need for social power, or it may transform into the need for personal power.  

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
Abraham Maslow  

Needs have precident. Some needs take precedence over others and must be met first. This is called _perpotency_.  
Maslow catagorized needs in th five types:  
1. _Physiological and survival needs_: The most basic human needs. This includes things like eating, drinking, having sex, sleeping, and breathing.  
2. _Safety and security needs_: A stability safe from threats. Examples could include safety from preditors, safety from the environment (cold, heat, rain), secure source of food and water.  
3. _Social needs_: Positive interactions with others, emotional connection with others, are examples of social needs.  
4. _Ego and esteem_: External and internal validation. A need to be recognized for our unique combination of abilities. Being skilled as a leader, as an athlete, success in business or politics, generally being respected within the community. External validation leads to internal validation.  
5. _Self-actualization_: This is about becoming the best that one can be at what it is that makes them who they are. Individuating and mastery.  

Maslow believes that these needs must be fulfilled in order. It can be pictured as a pyramid, where each layer is resting on top of the previous layer.  
Needs can become _dissatisfied_, and so the direction and intensity of motivation will refocus on that lower need and disregard the higher needs until it is satisfied.  
The implication for organizations is that they can help their employees focus on the needs that are beneficial to the organization (needs 4 and 5) by helping the employee meet the first three. This can be accomplished by providing adequate pay, a safe work environment, and positive group dynamics. These are needs that typically can be influenced by the organization.  

## Alderfer's ERG Theory
Clayton Alderfer reimagined Maslows five categories into three: _existence_, _relatedness_, and _growth_.  
He also expresses the dynamic movement between these categories by the individual.  
1. _Existence needs_: Physiological and material saftey. These needs are satisfied by material means.  
2. _Relatedness needs_: Maslow's social needs and social safety and esteem. These needs are satisfied through social interactions.  
3. _Growth needs_: Self-esteem and self-actualization. These needs are satisfied through involvement in one's work.

There are four components to moving between need satisfaction:  
1. _satisfation progression_: As one level of needs is met, the focus moves to the next level of needs.  
2. _frustration_: Failing to meet a need motivates the individual to try harder.  
3. _frustration regression_: Repeated failure to meet a need can refocus the individual to their previous level of need, reinforcing that success.  
4.  _aspiration_: The more needs are met, the more the individual wants to meed more needs.  

ERG Theory is useful because it's three categories of needs are easier to recognize than Maslow's five, and because it presents a clear set of motivations for moving between sets of needs in both directions.
