14.1 Motivation: Direction and Intensity
Define motivation and distinguish direction and intensity of motivation.  

**Ability** is defined as a combination of knowledge, skill, and receptiveness to learning: What you know, what you are adept at doing, and how well you can learn more.  
**Role perception** is defined as how well one understands their role (job) in the organization. The better understood, the more capable one is of meeting expectations.  
The **performance environment** is defined as environmental factors that impact an individuals performance. For examples are poor quality equipment, high levels of stress, a lack of nutrition will all interfere with ones ability to perform at peak potential.  
**Motivation** is defined as internal or external force or forces that "energize, direct, and sustain human behavior." Internal examples are values, goals, needs. External examples are reward, punishment, encouragement.  
**Work motivation** is defined as the amount of work a person will put in to achiveing a desired level of performance. To reach the goal one might, for example, put in more effort learning or practicing a skill, and sacrifice time spend socializing.  

Employers want motivated employees. "“What motivates people to perform
well?"  

Two major components of Motivation:  
**Direction**: A goal that a person wants to achive and a plan to do so.  
**Intensity**: The amout of effort a person is willing and able to exhert to reach their goal.  
_If either of these is lacking, success is unlikely._  

Employees might have _intensity_, but because they have an inacurate _role perception_ they lack the correct direction to succeed. Management can assist by clarifying direction and so providing a more accurate _role perception_ for their employee.  

There are many theories of motivation. Two categories of motivational theory are _content motivatin_ and _process motivation_.  
**Content motivation** focuses on _what_ motivates people.  
**Process motivation** focuses on _how_ people are motivated.  

1. Explain the two drivers of motivation: direction and intensity.  
**Direction**: A goal that a person wants to achive and a plan to do so.  
**Intensity**: The amout of effort a person is willing and able to exhert to reach their goal.  

2. What are the differences between content and process theories of motivation?  
**Content motivation** focuses on _what_ motivates people.  
**Process motivation** focuses on _how_ people are motivated.  

3. Will there ever be a grand theory of motivation?  
Probably not.  

## 14.2 Content Theories of Motivation
Describe a content theory of motivation.  

Content theory focuses on needs. A **need** is something that is lacking: food, sex, shelter, recognition, love. A **manifest need** is the current energized need.  

### Manifest Needs Theory
By the 1920's, behvioral scientists had identified around 6000 needs.  
Menry A. Murray condensed the list into categories of instinctive and learned needs. He called these **primary needs** and **secondary needs**.  
_Primary needs_: Instinctive, physiological needs like food, drink, sex, defication.  
_Secondary needs_: Learned needs like recognition, affiliation, love.  
Murry believes people have many needs, but express only a few at any given time. Expressed needs are **manifest needs**. His theory is called _The Manifest Needs Theory_. Needs not currently being expressed are called **latent needs**. Latent needs may not need to be expressed at a given time, or may not be able to be expressed because of the environemnt.  

### Learned Needs Theory
David C. McClelland built on the Manafest Needs Theory for 50 years. He and his team focused on three specific needs:  
* The need for achievement (nAch)
* The need for affiliation (nAff)
* The need for power (nPow)  

McClelland believed that although these needs are primarily learned in childhood, they can be taught, especially the need for achievement.  

#### Need for Achievement
The first of McClelland's learned needs.  
A **motive** is the source of motivation. When a person expresses _nAch_ and works hard to succeed they are said to have a _high achievement motive_.  
Three major characteristics of high-nAch people:  
1. Feeling responsible to complete assigned tasks.  
2. Prefer situations with a moderate possiblity to succeed.  
3. Have a strong desire for feedback, good or bad, on their performance.  

Organization's rely on their employees nAch levels. This is especially true for roles requiring self-motivation and management positions. High nAch people require less supervision, and so allow modern companies to be light weight and spend less on management.  
It is also important that organizations recognize and manage their employees needs to achive. Overly simple or complex tasks demotivate and lead to under achivement.  

#### Need for Affiliation
The second of McClelland's learned needs.  
High nAff people have a strong desire to build positive relationships with other people. They perform better where teamwork is required and are demotivated in isolated roles. Low nAff people shouldn't be thought of as disliking others, they simply don't put as much effort into establishing and maintaining friendly relationships.  

#### Need for Power
The third of McClelland's learned needs.  
These people have a need to control people and things. There are "two faces of the need for power":  
_The personal power seeker_ seeks to control others for the sake of controlling others. They want to be dominant. Their motivation is in the best interest of themselves, not the organization.  
_The social power seeker_ seeks to influence others in a positive way, and in the interest of the organization. They satisfy their power needs by stearing a team towards a successful outcome. McClelland belives this is the best kind of person for a managerial role. It is important that they are able to satisfy their need for social power, or it may transform into the need for personal power.  

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
Abraham Maslow  

Needs have precident. Some needs take precedence over others and must be met first. This is called _perpotency_.  
Maslow catagorized needs in th five types:  
1. _Physiological and survival needs_: The most basic human needs. This includes things like eating, drinking, having sex, sleeping, and breathing.  
2. _Safety and security needs_: A stability safe from threats. Examples could include safety from preditors, safety from the environment (cold, heat, rain), secure source of food and water.  
3. _Social needs_: Positive interactions with others, emotional connection with others, are examples of social needs.  
4. _Ego and esteem_: External and internal validation. A need to be recognized for our unique combination of abilities. Being skilled as a leader, as an athlete, success in business or politics, generally being respected within the community. External validation leads to internal validation.  
5. _Self-actualization_: This is about becoming the best that one can be at what it is that makes them who they are. Individuating and mastery.  

Maslow believes that these needs must be fulfilled in order. It can be pictured as a pyramid, where each layer is resting on top of the previous layer.  
Needs can become _dissatisfied_, and so the direction and intensity of motivation will refocus on that lower need and disregard the higher needs until it is satisfied.  
The implication for organizations is that they can help their employees focus on the needs that are beneficial to the organization (needs 4 and 5) by helping the employee meet the first three. This can be accomplished by providing adequate pay, a safe work environment, and positive group dynamics. These are needs that typically can be influenced by the organization.  

## Alderfer's ERG Theory
Clayton Alderfer reimagined Maslows five categories into three: _existence_, _relatedness_, and _growth_.  
He also expresses the dynamic movement between these categories by the individual.  
1. _Existence needs_: Physiological and material saftey. These needs are satisfied by material means.  
2. _Relatedness needs_: Maslow's social needs and social safety and esteem. These needs are satisfied through social interactions.  
3. _Growth needs_: Self-esteem and self-actualization. These needs are satisfied through involvement in one's work.

There are four components to moving between need satisfaction:  
1. _satisfation progression_: As one level of needs is met, the focus moves to the next level of needs.  
2. _frustration_: Failing to meet a need motivates the individual to try harder.  
3. _frustration regression_: Repeated failure to meet a need can refocus the individual to their previous level of need, reinforcing that success.  
4. _aspiration_: The more needs are met, the more the individual wants to meed more needs.  

ERG Theory is useful because it's three categories of needs are easier to recognize than Maslow's five, and because it presents a clear set of motivations for moving between sets of needs in both directions.  

### Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory
Daniel Herzberg  
_Motivator-Hygiene Theory_ further reduces Maslow's categories to two: _Motivators_ and _Hygienes_.  
**Motivators** are anything that leads to personal growth. In the workplace, they are connected to _job content_, what the individual in a given role actually does. Accomplishments and recognition are _satisfiers_ that lead to higher job performance, and higher job performance leads to satisfaction.  
**Hygienes** Are the factors in our work environment that lead to dissatisfaction. _Dissatisfiers_ reduce motivation and lead to poorer job performance.  
Hygienes could include low pay, innept management, and a poor work condition. It is important to know that correcting these does not lead to satisfaction, it simply reduces dissatisfaction. Motivators, like satisfying job challenges, responsibility, and recognition, are required to motivate and increase performance. Motivators and hygienes are essentially on two seperate scales.  

### Self-Determination Theory
**Extrinsic motivation**: Factors outside of the person. These are low order, existance needs like food, shelter, money, safety. The individual performs tasks necessary to survive.  
**Intrinsic motivation**: Factors inside of the person. These are higher order needs like growth and relatedness. The individual performs tasks because they gain satisfaction from them.  

**STD** finds that high extrinsic rewards can actually reduce intrinsic motivation. By paying someone a great deal to perform tasks that satisfy them, the tasks become less personally satisfying, and more about the extrinsic reward. The implication for management is that skilled employees need intrinsic motivation as well to succeed. This can take the form of new opportunities to maintain stimulation, and challanges that lead to intrisic satisfaction. On the other hand, workers performing low-skilled, inherantly unsatisfying work require high extrinsic reward to maintain motivation.  

1. Understand the content theories of motivation.  
Content motivation focuses on what motivates people.  

2. Understand the contributions that Murray, McClelland, Maslow, Alderfer, and Herzberg made toward an understanding of human motivation.  
Murry's Manifest Needs Theory established the idea of primary and secondary needs. McClelland's Learned Needs Theory build off of Murry and focused on three specific needs: achievement, affiliation, and power. Maslow added the very popular concept of a hierarchy of needs, and conceptualized five needs: Physiological and survival, safety and security, social ego and esteem, and self-catualization. Alderfer's ERG Theory reduced these to three categories: existence, relatedness, and growth. He also explained the factors that move individuals between hierarchial levels of needs. Herzberg reduced these further to two categories of needs: motivator and hygiene. He called motivators satisfiers, and hygiene dissatisfiers.  

## 14.3 Process Theories of Motivation
Describe the process theories of motivation, and compare and contrast the main process theories of motivation: operant conditioning theory, equity theory, goal theory, and expectancy theory.  

Process theories focus on behaviors, and how people are motivated.  

### Operand Conditioning Theory
The theory is that people learn behaviors by behaving (operating) and responding to the consequences of that behavior. People continue to behave in ways that have positive rewards, and avoid behaving in ways that have negative rewards (punishment).  

#### The Basic Operant Model
The learning of behaviors has three steps:  
1. _Stimulus_: Any environmental factor that the person responds to.  
2. _Response_: The behavior taken in response to the stimulus.  
3. _Consequence_: The resulting event that influences the likelyhood of the person repeating the behavior in the future.

&nbsp;  

**Reinforcement** is the increased likelyhood of the behavior reoccuring, based on the positive consequence.  
**Extinction** is the decreased likelyhood of the bahavior reoccuring, based on the negative consequence.  

#### Making a Response More Likely
**Positive reinforcement** is rewarding a behavior to encourage it being repeated. Examples are praise, prizes, promotions.  
**Negative reinforcement** is taking away something that is negative as a reward for a behavior. Examples are removing criticism, nagging, repeated reminders.  
**Avoidance learning** is incentivising behavior that avoids a consequence. Examples are avoiding punitive actions like a demotion, job termination, eviction.  

#### Making a Response Less Likely
**Punishment** is a negative consequence to reduce the likelyhood of a behavior repeating.  
**Nonreinforcement** is doing nothing, not reinforcing the behavior by not even presenting a consequence. This can be problematic. When a behavior is positive but is not acknowledged, nonreinforcement reduces the likelyhood of the behavior being repeated.  

#### Schedules of Reinforcement
_Shaping_ is reinforcing new behaviors frequently (possibly every time) when they are being learned. This should not, however, persist too long or it will become expected (_continuous reinformcement_), and when it finally stops the individual will become demotivated through nonreinforcement.  
There are four **schedules of reinforcement**:  
_Fixed Ratio_: A set number of repetitions evokes a reinforcement (reward).  
_Variable Ratio_: A set average number of repetitions evokes a reinforcement.  
_Fixed Interval_: After a fixed interval of time, an observed positive behavior is reinforced. This could be a different behavior at any given interval, but the time between reinforcement is fixed. It is also possible there is no behavior observed, and so nothing to reinforce.  
_Variable Interval_: Like fixed interval, but an average interval of time is set. The interval is not fixed, but the average is maintained.  

After the continuous reinforcement of shaping is completed, some kind of variable interval is considered important to maintain positive behaviors. Fixed intervals and ratios are not considered as effective.  

### Equity Theory
John Stacey Adams  

Motivation is affected by an individuals perception of both whether their outcomes are equal to the effort they put in, and whether their outcomes are equal to other individual's outcomes for the same percieved efforts.  
In other words, if two people do the same quality of work, and one receives more compensation, the other will be demotivated.  

#### The Basic Equity Model
_Equity Theory_ has two sets of factors:  
**Inputs**: are what an individual perceives as efforts put into the organization for which they are a part. This could be hard work, level of performance, time, sacrafice. The value is what the individual perceives it to be.  
**Outcomes**: are what the individual perceives getting back for their efforts. This could be money, a raise, a promotion, recognition. The value is again what the individual perceives it to be.  

The individual will compare their value of their inputs to their value of their outcomes as a ratio. If the individual perceives that the outcomes are equitable to the inputs, they are satisfied. If they perceive that the outcomes are less than the inputs, they are dissatisfied. They will also compare their ratio to others in the organization. If they feel that others have a better ratio of outcomes to inputs than they do, they may also become dissatisfied.  
The term **referent others** refers to people an individual will compare their ratio to. These are typically people who perform similar tasks at a similar level as the individual. They are called referent because the individual uses them as a reference for their sense of equity. There are three possible results of these comparisons: _state of equity_, _overreward inequity_, _underreward inequity_.  

Two human tendancies that create a false sence of inequity are the tendancy to overrate one's performance, and the tendancy to overrate other's outcomes. That is, individuals tend to think they are performing at a much higher level than they are, and tend to assume others are being compensated at a higher value than they are.  

#### Perceived Overreward Inequity
Perceived overreward inequity does not tend to motivate the individual to work harder to achive equity. Typically they are satisfied with the overreward.  

#### Perceived Underreward Inequity
Perceived underreward inequity causes dissatisfaction and motivates to change the situation.  

#### Reducing Underreward Inequity
1. Alter inputs of the person: Simply put, don't work so hard.  
2. Alter outcomes of the person: Work harder and seek an increase in outcomes.  
3. Alter inputs of the referent other: Encourage the other to put in more inorder to make their (percieved) inputs match their superior outcomes.  
4. Alter outcomes of the refernt other: Work to reduce the outcomes of the referent other.  
5. Distort perceptions of inputs or outcomes: Change the perception of the other's inputs or outcomes to create perceived equity.  
6. Choose a different referent other: Use a different party to compare one's inputs and outcomes to.  
7. Leave the situation: Quit, transfer, call in sick.  

#### Implications of Equity Theory
People tend towards perceiving underreward inequity. This is bad for organizations. It is important for organizations and managers to treat individuals fairly. Avoid playing favorites. Some salary transparency can be helpful (publishing the range for a given role, for example). Develop and use methods to measure performance that are as accurate as possible.  
  
### Goal Theory
Edwin A. Locke  

"...people will perform better if they have difficult, specific, accepted performance goals or objectives."

#### The Basic Goal-Setting Model
People try to achive goals that they intend to achive. If one intends to accomplish something they will exert more energy to succeed at that goal than if they don't intend to. Example: Studying for the sake of studying vs. studying with the intention of learning the subject or attaining a specific score or rank.  
Difficult goals drive people to try harder than simple goals. This doesn't guarentee success, but it does likely result in a better outcome than without the added effort.  
Specific goals are better than vague ones.  
People must accept the goal. It's one thing to be given a goal (by say a manager), it is another to accept it, and to accept that it is achievable. If a person doesn't accept the goal, or doesn't feel the goal is achievable, they are unlikely to give it the required effort. 

**Goal commitment** measures the degree of dedication to a goal. A person may have multiple goals (major and minor). Major goals have more of the person's commitment than the minor goals.  
When people are included in the goal-setting process, they are more likely to have a sense of ownership and be more committed to the goal. Goals set externally ten do result in less commitment and acceptance.  

To evoke maximum effort, goals should be difficult but obtainable, specific, accepted, and committed to. It is also important to remove constraints that could derail the effort (such as other people prioritizing their own requests over the person, or inadequate resources). If a goal can not be obtained it can demotivate future efforts.  

_Management by objectives_ is a management style based on goal-setting theory.  

* Some drawbacks to goal-setting theory:  
* Neglecting goals in one area for another.  
* Setting easy goals to create a more positive impression of performance.  
* Unhealthy competition between coworkers.  
* Sabotage.  
* Used unethically by management to create a negative impression of an employee.
* Focuses on quantitative performance rather than qualitative performance.  

### Expectancy Theory
