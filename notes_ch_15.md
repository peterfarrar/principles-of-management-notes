## 15.1 Teamwork in the Workplace
What is a team, and what makes a team effective?  

Katzenbach and Smith, Harvard Business Review (HBR): “The Discipline of Teams”   
Five elements that make teams functional:  
* Common commitment and purpose
* Specific performance goals
* Complementary skills
* Commitment to how the work gets doen
* Mutual accountability  

A **working group** is usually organized as a functional area with a focused leader. It is part of the larger organization and shares the same organizations goals. Individuals have personal accountability for their work.  

Qualities of successful teams:  
_Establish urgency, demanding performance standards, and direction_: Provide challenge and a reason for the team to succeed. And provide clear direction.  
_Select members for their skills and skill potential, not for their personality_: A pleasant personality is fine, but more importantly is that members have the skills required to succeed, or the ability to learn them. It is important to analize the project and define the necessary skills. It is also likely that other skills will materialize as necessary as the project develops.  
_Pay particular attentinon to first meetings and actions_: Like individuals, a teams first impression goes a long way. Make sure your team has _emotional intelligence_ and presents well to outsiders (other teams as well as leaders).  
_Set some clear rules of behavior_: Take the time to set ground rules up front. These include behaviors around attendance, conflict, confidentiality. Also, how to communicate and approach the project.  
_Set and seize upon a few immediate performance-oriented tasks and goals_: Quick wins will help the team gel and raise members confidence.  
_Challenge the group regularly with fresh facts and information_: Constantly gather new, relevant information. Challenge and/or confirm assumptions about the project.  
_Spend lots of time together_: Time together in person, in meetings, over the phone or internet, helps to build trust and affinity.  
_Exploit the power of positive feedback, recognition, and reward_: Positive reinforcement motivates team members to contribute. Success becomes the best reward.  

**Collaboration** is important for teams working together. Gratton and Erickson, in their article "Eight Ways to Build Collaborative Teams" identify these factors for strong collaboration:  
* "Signature" relationship practices
* Role models of collaboration among executives
* Establishment of "gift" culture, in which managers mentor employees
* Training in relationship skills
* A sense of community
* Ambidextrous leaders—good at task and people leadership
* Good use of heritage relationships
* Role clarity and talk ambiguity2

1. What is the definition of a team?  
An group of people organized to function cooperatively.   

2. Name some practices that can make a team more successful.  
Setting clear rules of behavior, attacking easy wins up front to build cohesion and confidence, members spending time together.  

## 15.2 Team Development Over Time
How do teams develop over time?  

**Tuckman’s Stages of Group Development**  
* Forming
* Storming
* Norming
* Performing
* Adjourning

_Forming_: The "polite stage." The team is looks to the leader for structure direction. Members are enthusiastic. Ambiguous.  
_Storming_: The "win-lose stage." Individuals test the group, look for dominance and control in the team. Frustratopm anpit goals, tasks, progress.  
_Norming_: Team stats to work well. Members buy-in to the goals. Members begin to respect each other and what they have to offer.  
_Performing_: Shared vision and team identity. Self directed and enthusiastic. The team has the posibility of becoming high performing, optimizing tasks and interpersonal relationships to maximize team effectiveness.  
_Adjourning_: The winding down of the team. Not really discussed.  

This in not necessarily linear. Adding new members, projects, or tasks can disrupt the flow and possibly regress the team to an earlier stage.  

>_Sidebar_: Noam Wasserman’s January 2012 HBSP article "Assembling the Startup Team"  
The three Rs: relationships, roles, and rewards.  

1. What are the four stages of team development?  
Forming, storming, norming, performing.

2. What can cause a team to regress in its development?
Intrduction of new variables like new members, projects, tasks can change team dynamics or otherwise be disruptive enough to cause the team to regress to earlier stages of development.  

## 15.3 Things to Consider When Manageing Teams
What are some key considerations in managing teams?  

While companies are focused on goals and priorities, teams are made of people. And it takes successful teams to attain the organizations goals. So getting people to want, and to understand how, to work together is an often unspoken priority for managers.  

>_Sidebar_: Managing a new team means recognizing and managing all the stakeholders, not just the members of the team. It is a good idea to create a list of these people and build relationships with them in order to be successful.  
>
>Useful questions to determin stakeholders:
>* Whose support will I need?
>* Who needs my support? What do they need from me or my team?
>* Who can keep me and my team from being successful?
>* What is my ongoing influencing strategy?

&nbsp;  
Linda A. Hill, Harvard Business Review: "Managing Your Team"  
* Fostering support AND confrontation among team members
* Focusing on performance AND learning and development
* Balancing managerial authority AND team member discretion and autonomy
* Balancing the Triangle of Relationships—manager, team, and individual

_The triangle of support_ is the balance between the manager and the team, the manager and the team members, and between the individuals in the team.  

_Managing a teams boundries_ involves acting as a boundry between the team and external forces that might interupt, distract, or derail the team. It also involves recognizing stakeholders that are both in favor of the teams success, and for whatever reason would prefer it to fail. Steps that the manager can take to help the team succeed include building relationships with stakeholders that can impact the teams outcomes, and educate stakeholders about elements in the environment that are interfering with the teams success. These can include organizational structures, systems, and company politics, to name a few.  

Managing the team means managing the people and the process. For process there are incremental milestones and meeting and rituals that keep the team moving forward towards it's objectives. Milestones can be celebrated. And tools to manage the project should be selected to match the culture of the team and the organization. For managing people, managers can help to set rules and norms for the culture and behavior of the members. Rules can include the skills, functions, expertise required to achive results. Culture includes team values, work ethics, the decision making process, conflict resolution, and expectations. And acting as a coach, a manager can help the team thing through problems, provide guidance and feedback, and hold members accountable.  

1. Discuss the paradox(es) of a team.  
The paradox is arises from teams having individual and group identities. Individual's goals can come into conflict with the groups goals.  

2. How can a leader manage team boundaries?  
Managing a teams boundries involves acting as a boundry between the team and external forces that might interupt, distract, or derail the team. It also involves recognizing stakeholders that are both in favor of the teams success, and for whatever reason would prefer it to fail. Steps that the manager can take to help the team succeed include building relationships with stakeholders that can impact the teams outcomes, and educate stakeholders about elements in the environment that are interfering with the teams success. These can include organizational structures, systems, and company politics, to name a few.  

## 15.4 Opportunities and Challenges to Team Building
What are the benefits of conflict for a team?  

Conflict is generally seen as a negative, and can cause disruption and mistrust within the group. However it can also expose diverse and opposing view points and enhance problem solving, highlight contentions and content that need to be addressed. If the members of the team trust each other they can work through conflict to be a stronger, more productive team from the experience.  

Patrick Lencioni, _The five Dysfunctions of a Team_:
The first dysfunction is _the absense of trust_. If team members can not be honest about tehir mistakes and weaknesses they can not build trust. This leads to the second dysfunction, _the fear of conflict_. Without trust there can be no honest debate of ideas. The lack of honest debate leads to the thrid dysfunction, _the lack of commitment_.  
Teams may avoid open conflict to protect teammates feelings. Unfortunately the conflict is still there and may express itself in more insidious ways.  
Two strategies to help manage conflict and make it more productive are conflict **mining** and **real-time permission**. Conflict mining requires one team member to extract the hidden disagreements and call them out. Real-time permission invloves recognizing when the dialog around a conflict becomes uncomfortable for one or more team members (contentious, even), and interupting to remind the team the purpose of the discourse, which is to build trust and make the team stronger and more productive.  
Leaders can facilitate a teams growth by addressing conflicts, bringing them out to be discusses and resolved. This will help build a successful team. Supressing conflict, on the other hand, will undermine the team's success.  

Capobianco, Davis, and Kraus, _Managing Conflict Dynamics: A Practical Approach_:  
Individuals respond differently. Recognize that there are constructive and destructive, and active and passive ways to respond to conflict. The goal in responding to conflict is to have a positive result. Constructive approaches, active and passive, are encouraged and encourage dialog, learning, and resolution.

## 15.5 Team Diversity
How does team diversity enhance decision-making and problem-solving?  

Diverse teams bring diverse perspectives. This creates a superior environment in which to solve problems and make decisions.  

David Rock and Heidi Grant, HBR, "“Why Diverse Teams are Smarter" (Nov. 2016):  
Public companies with more ethnically and racially diverse management teams were 30% more likely to beat the industry mean. Public companies with more geneder diverse management teams were 15% more likely to beat the industry mean. Boards with at least one woman had higher returns than those without  

Evidence shows that diverse teams are more likely to examine and reexamine facts, verify facts, and rely on facts when making decisions. It is believed that homoginous teams are more suseptible to groupthink, less likely to recognize biases, or to consider opposing views. Diverse teams tend to scrutinize, and encourage scrutiny of each others ideas. They appear to make fewer factual errors.  

Boston Consulting Group and Technical University of Munich article: "The Mix that Matters: Innovatin through Diversity":  
Diverse management teams generate greater innovation.  
* There is a statistically significant corrolation between diversity and greater innovation. Diversity leads to greater revenue from novel products and services.  
* Many types of diversity apply: Race, country of origin, gender. Also individuals coming from other organizations or industries improve results.  
* This is particularly impactful in complex companies, meaning multi-product and multi-industry.  
* Gender diversity requires at least 20% of the members be from the other gender (typically women) for the impact to be felt.  
* Diverse management teams, open communication, welcome contribution from lower-level workers are critical to innovation.  

Leaders need to consider the benefits of diversity when forming a new team.  

1. Why do diverse teams focus more on data than homogeneous teams?  
In diverse teams, each member of the team arrives with different sets of biases. By utilizing and scrutinizing data they are able to disern what is factual and what is not. Because they do not all share the same biases they must recognize and defend or abandon their personal biases based on factual information.  

2. How are diversity and innovation related?  
There is a statistically significant corrolation between diversity and greater innovation.  

## 15.6 Multicultural Teams
What are some challenges and best practices for managing and working with multicultural teams?  

Multi-cultural teams are diverse teams that present a unique set of challenges that must be overcome to be successful.  

Harvard Business Review, "Managing Multicultural Teams":  
Four key cultural differences:  
1. Direct vs indirect communication
2. Trouble with accents and fluency
3. Differing attitudes towards hierarchy
4. Conflicting decision-making norms

_Direct vs indirect communication_: Direct cultures use and are used to explicit communications, while indirect cultures often ask questions to shape the conversation, rather than direct confrontations. Each may percieve the other as rude or unproductive.  
_Trouble with accents and fluency_: In multi-lingual groups, one language will usually become dominant, dominishing the ablility of non-fluent member's to contribute. The two sides of this are that the non-fluent individual feels left out of the process, while the fluent individuals may perceive them as under-contributing.  
_Differing attitudes towards hierarchy_: Members from cultures that are highly respectful of hierarchy may feel disrespected by members from more egalitarian cultures, which can be counter productive to the goals of the group.  
_Conflicting decision-making norms_: Some cultures prepare their positions, analysis, and expectations well in advance of the initial discussion and expect a quick process. Other cultures take a great deal of time considering the proposed decisions, which can frustrate those members expecting a quick resolution.  

Interventions to address these conflicts:  
**Adaption**: By recongnizing cultural differences, members can work with or around them.  
**Structural intervention**: By identifying unproductive subgroups within the team, the team can be restructured to break them up and reduce conflict.  
**Managerial intervention**: A less desirable intervention is to shift decision making to management. Unfortuantly this can be percived negatively by the team.  
**Exit**: If there is a specific member, or specific members, of the team that simply can not find a way to work productively with the rest of the team, they can voluntarily or involuntarily be removed.  

#### Cultural Intelligence
Awareness of cultural differences.  
Ability to adapt to cultural norms.  

Lee and Liao, IESE Insight, "Cultural Competence: Why It Matters and How You Can Acquire It" (2015):  
To raise personal awareness of cultural differences, some things one can do are to consume media from other cultures, travel, and build relationships with individuals from other cultures.  

> Sidebar:  
> HBR article “Getting Cross-Cultural Teamwork Right:  
> * mutual learning
> * mutual understanding
> * mutual teaching
>
> _Mutual Learning_: Members learn from each other by observing and listening to each other.  
> _Mutual understanding_: Members look to understand the logic and reason behind cultural behaviors.  
> _Mutual teaching_: Members share the cultural explanation of their own behaviors in hopes of resolving any misunderstandings.  

**Congnitive complexity** means viewing situations from a multi-cultural set of viewpoints. It requires strong emotional intelligence, empathy, and sympathy, and engaging in honest communications.  

Christopher Earley and Elaine Mosakowski, Harvard Business Review, "Cultural Intelligence" (Oct. 2004):
Three models: Head, body, heart.  
The head: Educate oneself about the culture to better understand it.  
The body: Take on the physical behaviors to better assimilate and connect with others.  
The heart: Have the self-confidence to commit to understanding the culture.  

Cultural Intelligence is an extention of Emotional Intellegence. For multi-cultural teams to succeed, members must take the time and make the effort to understand and work with each others cultural differences so that everyone is included and valued in the process.  

1. What are some of the challenges of a multicultural team?  
The Harvard Business Review article  "Managing Multicultural Teams" lays out four key cultural differences that can challenge the success of multi-cultural teams. They are:
>1. Direct vs indirect communication
>2. Trouble with accents and fluency
>3. Differing attitudes towards hierarchy
>4. Conflicting decision-making norms

2. Explain the cultural intelligence techniques of head, body, and heart.  
The head: Educate oneself about the culture to better understand it.  
The body: Take on the physical behaviors to better assimilate and connect with others.  
The heart: Have the self-confidence to commit to understanding the culture.
