## 18.1 MTI - It's Importance Now and In the Future
What do we mean by management of technology and innovation (MTI), and why is it crucial?  

Change is constant.  

**Technology** is defined as the processes in an organization that convert inputs into outputs.  
**Management of technology** is "...the planning, implementation, evaluation, and control of the organizationâ€™s resources and capabilities in order to create value and competitive advantage."  

Key concepts:  
* Technology strategy
* Technology forecasting
* Technology roadmap
* Technology project portfolio and technology portfolio

_Technology strategy_ is determining the role of technology within the organization.  
_Technoloty forcasting_ is observing the environment, recognizing and forecasting technological changes, and evaluating the potential positive and negative impact on the organiztion.  
_Technology roadmaping_ is planning how to take advantage of a new technology to add value to the organization.  
_Technology project portfolio_ is the collection of an organization's technology projects.  

**Management of innovation**: Change management and the managing of processes that encourage innovation.  
### The 5 Cs
_Casting a wide net_: Innovation moves fast. If an organization is too conservative they will miss opportunities that could exit them from the market place. Casting a wide net means recognizing changes as opportunities and incorporating them into the organizations operations and offerings. Some will fail to produce, others may prove to be invaluable.  
_Createing Newness_: An existing product may have additional value. Reimagining it's use, adding newness to it, can unlock this value.  
_Creating a culture of newness_: Leadership can encourage innovation by being open to new ideas from all areas of their orgnaization.  
_Communicating knowledge_: Sharing knowledge across the organization allows individuals not directly related to a project to recognize alternative uses or variations for a given innovation. Some innovations may appear inappropriate for their intended uses, but an objective assessment may identify novel uses.  
_Changing with courage_: Organizations must have the courage to change when the environment changes. If not, they can be left behind and exit the market place. Studying the environment and recognizing changes that need to be addressed or embrased is essencial to remain competitive and viable.  

### Six critical areas of Management of Technology and innovation

1. _Management of Human Resources_: Evolving technologies means changing tools in the work place. It's important to provide training for employees to help them adapt to new ways of working.  
2. _Cooperative Model Expansion_: To share risk and speed development and implementation of new technologies, organizations form alliances with experts and other organizations.  
3. _Internationalization_: Innovation, around new _and_ existing products, can open new markets at home and abroad.  
4. _Issues around Environmental Concerns_: MTI needs to be sensitive to the impact of various sources of energy. Fossil fuels add carbon to the atmosphere, nuclear power can have potentially catastrophic outcomes if there is a systems failure, and hydro-power like damns can have significant impact on the ecosystem.  
5. _Growth of Service Industries_: Knowledge and Information based economies are producing increases in service based businesses. This is expected to continue.  
6. _Use of Intellectual Property Rights as a Stratevic Resource_: IPR should be managed as a valuable assets. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks give organizations a competitive advantage, and create opportunities to generate additional revenue through licensing.

## 18.2 Developing Technology and Innovation
How do organizations develop technology and innovation?  

**Organization-level and three strategic processes**  

The dynamic nature of innovation reqires agility. But agility is inefficient in the short term. Here are four things an organization can to do balance this:  
1. Designing systems and processes: Find opportunities arrising in the environment that based on technologies that can be identified or developed.  
2. Identifying communication needs: Turn the wealth of data available in to communicable information. Use that information to make the best decisions possible as effectivly and efficiently as possible.  
3. Implementing training and development to address change: The more dynamic the environment, the more important it is to ensure employees at all levels of the orgnaization have access to training and opportunities to enhance their skills and match the changes in technologies.  
4. Using execllent change management processes: To maximize impact and improve the odds of successful implementation of new technologies, change management processes need to integrate the new technology effectivlely into the oranizations internal environment. This means insuring employees are able to understand, utilize, and embrase the new technology. Communicating, modeling, and training are examples of how this can be done.  

**The three basic organizational processes** are _buying and partnering_, _developing newness_, and _entrepreneurially exploiting a space in the environment_.  
* Buying and partnering includes joint vntures, acquisitions, informal relatinoships, etc.
* Developing newness includes R&D, new products or processes, or modifying existing processes, etc.  
* Exploiting a space in the environment includes creating a new business, identifying and entering a new space.  

There are pros and cons to each of these processes:

## 18.3 External Sources of Technology and Innovation
What are external sources of technology and innovation development, and when are they best used?  

Three reasons to aquire technology and innovations are:
1. The organization has fallen behind the competition.  
2. A new entrant has disrupted or otherwise changed the competitive nature of the market-place.  
3. The organization forcasts a need for an innovation or technology in order to be competitive in the future.  

_Advantages_: Speed and cost savings of integrating the technology vs that of developing it in-house.
_Disadvantage_: Challenges of integrating aquisitions or new experts into the culture of the organization, internal resistance to the change.  

Common external processes to introduce new technologies and/or innovations:  
1. **Mergers and acquisitions**: A new, larger organization is created. The new technologies or innovations are integrated across this organiztion.  
2. **Joint ventures**: A new entity is created to manage the partnership. Each organizations obligations are contractually specified. Disadvantages also include _strategic drift_ (losing focus of the partnerships original purpose).  
3. **Franchise agreements**: Long term agreements in which the francisee licences or other wise contractually has access to the franchisers name and technology. Disadvantages also include the burden of associated franchise costs.  
4. **Licensing agreements**: Allows the use of the desired technology without having to develop it in-house, or aquire through other mentioned methods. Costs may be a disadvantage.  
5. **Formal and informal contracts**: Firms can share technology for various length of time.

## 18.4 Internal Sources of Technology and Innovation
What are internal sources of technology and innovation development, and when are they best used?  

_Advantages_: Ownership, legal protections, knowledge gained in the process of developing the new solution, may gain competitive advantage by being first to innovate.  
_Disadvantage_: Slower and more expensive, requires retention of key team members.

## 18.5 Management Entrepreneurship Skills for Technology and Innovation
How and why do entrepreneurs need to develop MTI skills?  

A **value proposition** should answer these two questions:  
1. How will the organzation generate revenue from the product or service?  
2. How will the organization position itself in the marketplace?  

_Advantages_: Entrepreneurs are dedicated to the organization. The organization is lean and can advance incrementally. Small ventures can be agile (able to adapt quickly).  
_Disadvantage_: New businesses typically have limited funds and other resources with which to operate.

## 18.6 Skills Needed for MTI  
No matter what method is used, what skills do you need to successfully manage technology and innovation?  

Two necessary organizational skills for succesful MTI are:  
**Learning and Knowldege management.**  
**Forecast and Analysis of Future Trends.**  
Individual skills are **leadership** (and **followship**), and **creative thinking**.  

The _learning and knowledge_ process builds capabilities by collecting data, analyzing that data, converting it into information, and communicating that information. Learning from that information creates tacit knowledge, and in codifying that knowlege, it becomes explicit knowledge that can give an organization a competitive advantage. This is sometimes called **organizational leraning**. To accomplish this the organization must bring together the right people and resources. Note that sometimes it is dificult or simply not possible to codify tacit knowledge. In those cases the knowledge remains with the individual or individuals.  

An effective _forecasting process_ leads to superior strategies that add value to the organization. This is accomplished by scanning the competitive environment to identify opportunities, and understanding the associated risks. Forecasting methods are imperfect and produce uncertain outcomes. Even statistical analysis is uncertain as it relys on numbers that are often the result of other forecasts, or can be impacted by unanticipated changes in the environment. The outputs of the learning and knowledge process can also provide inputs for the forecasting process.  


#### Followship
As projects progress the roles of the team members shift. A leader early in a project may become a follwer later, and vice versa. Good followship is as or more important than good leadership, as a leader without a follower isn't leading anything.  
Qualities of a good follower:  
1. Truthfulness. Tell the leader what they need to hear.  
2. Supportiveness. Self explanitory. Support the leader. I.e. don't undermine them.  
3. Share knowledge and experience. Provide input based on personal experience and know how.  
4. Provide solutions. Take initiative.  
5. Provide information. Leaders may be removed from the situation. Share honest truth about the state of the project.
